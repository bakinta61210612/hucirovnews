When I started painting, I didn’t want it to be a sob story.</p><p>“I wanted to show strength. We can survive and still be beautiful, kind, caring people. And all that because of the people around me, who were in my life.”</p><h3>Start your day informed</h3><p>Our Morning Edition newsletter is a curated guide to the most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
