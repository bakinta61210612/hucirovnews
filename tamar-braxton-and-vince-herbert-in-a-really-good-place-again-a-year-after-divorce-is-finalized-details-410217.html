As fans know, she has been in another relationship, with <a href=#>David Adefeso</a>, for the past two years or so and she is the ‘happiest she’s ever been.’</p><p>Prior to her finding love again, however, the woman filed for divorce amid accusations Vince cheated on her so it makes sense that they were not the friendliest for a while.</p><p>However, now that she is so happy with another man and some time has passed, they are pretty close again.</p><p>Almost one year after the divorce was finalized, back in July of 2019, one source tells HollywoodLife that ‘Tamar and Vince are finally in a really good place again and she’s very happy about it. It’s pretty recent that things got this good and they’re able to work together so closely again. She has been busy working on several projects and Vince has even been giving his input again. He even has come to set while she was working on a few times [of her VH1 show] before quarantine quietly while she was filming.’</p><p>They went on to say that ‘Tamar has always appreciated Vince’s career advice. It’s taken a lot of work, but they’ve come so far. He’s consulting her a lot again. She had a really rough relationship with Vince and never thought she’d be able to go back to him for advice again, but she’s happy he’s being so supportive of her career. She’s the happiest she’s ever been in her current relationship.’</p><p>The insider also stressed that no matter what happens, Tamar has zero intention of ever getting back together with Vince in a romantic way.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Working together is a whole different story, however, and her current boyfriend doesn’t mind it either.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklrqivoybqZqwpKS7bq3NnWSvoZ6Ysm60xKuZnqqkYravecBmqZ6ZnKHGbrPOqJtmqJyWsKZ5wKCYoqZdlnq6scCrZJqepJq%2FbrDIr6arm5VitrR5xaKlmqSZr7KlecOeq5qhnKh6dX2Pa2hwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
