The Lancome spokeswoman’s makeup looked bold and classic as her blonde locks framed her face in loose curls.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does she look stunning, but the Divergent star also opened up about her family and husband <strong>Ned Rocknroll</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Nobody knows him—it’s brilliant,” she said of the nephew of Virgin Group tycoon <strong>Richard Branson</strong>. “They like to think they know him.

Lucky she’s tiny! She’s my son’s great-grandmother now, so it’s such a strange thing to talk about.”</p><p>The fire certainly had an impact on Winslet and Rocknroll. They even gave their son the middle name Blaze.&nbsp;</p><p>“We had to get the fire thing in there somewhere,” she quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGakmaSaeri1zayjnqxdrLKivtJmo6Kml5q%2FqrGMqaasrF2XrqPFjKecnWWipLCsutGoo6VlYmV%2BdX6Pbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
