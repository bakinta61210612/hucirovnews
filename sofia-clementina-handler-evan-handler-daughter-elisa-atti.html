Apart from that, she also travels around with her parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Evan-Handler-and-her-daughter-travel-aroud.jpg><p>Sofia has gained immense fame as the daughter of popular actor Evan Handler.

At the age of 23, Handler was given six months to live. He survived after intensive chemotherapy, a long-shot bone-marrow transplant, and a 50-percent chance of remission. He has written a memoir about the journey that he endured between the hospital and HBO. In the book, he has also mentioned breaking up with 10 women 27 times, becoming an unlikely sex symbol, and offering to volunteer at the cancer center that he hated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Evan-Handler-is-a-famous-actor.jpg><p>The 60-year old actor is in remission and has recalled his experience before and after the sickness in his books.</p><p>According to various sources, Sofia Clementina Handler’s mother, Elisa Atti, is a medical researcher. In one of his Twitter posts, he uploaded a picture mentioning his wife’s profession as a chemistry professor at a college. However, it is not confirmed yet if Sofia’s mother is still in the same profession or if she has changed the profession.</p><p>Elisa seems to love her life away from the glamour and the limelight. She is not that active on her social media. Due to this, her profession and personal life are still a mystery. But we hope to discover more information related to her in the days to come.</p><p>Furthermore, Evan uploads various pictures of food made by his wife. Seems like she loves cooking and feeds different delicious foods.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Name_Meaning></span>Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The name Sofia has a Spanish origin, which means “Wisdom.” Similarly, Clementina has an English origin, and it means “Gentle, Merciful.”</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
