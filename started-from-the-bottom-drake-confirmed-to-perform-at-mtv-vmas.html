Drizzy is scheduled to perform his song “Started From The Bottom”&nbsp;on live television for the first time. According to MTV.com:</p><p>“As if his infectious hit wasn’t proof enough,&nbsp;Drake&nbsp;is proving that he’s here when he returns to the&nbsp;MTV Video Music Awards&nbsp;on Sunday to give his first live television performance of ‘Started from the Bottom.’</p><p>“The video for his&nbsp;<i>Nothing Was the Same</i>&nbsp;lead single is up for two awards at this year’s show, including Best Direction and Best Hip Hop Video. (And judging from his&nbsp;tweet&nbsp;Wednesday morning, he’s particularly motivated to go home with one of the coveted&nbsp;<a href=#>Kaws-designed Moonmen</a>. While he was there at last year’s VMAs to accept the Best Hip Hop award for “HYFR” with Lil Wayne, this will mark his first performance since 2010.”</p><p>The news isn’t all good from Drake’s camp. While he will be performing the lead single from his upcoming album, “<i>Nothing Was The Same,” </i>the album has been reportedly pushed back. According to vibe.com:</p><p>“But the good news comes with a minor setback as the Toronto MC will be pushing back the release of his album by one week. According to&nbsp;Hits Daily Double&nbsp;andBest Buy,&nbsp;<i>NWTS</i>&nbsp;is now scheduled to hit shelves Sept. 24.”</p><p>That’s only a week’s difference, so the delay shouldn’t affect fans much. In today’s digital distribution age, albums typically get leaked early—so fans may end up with the original September 17 date after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX50e49xZmtpX6jBor7TnptmnqKkum7Ax55km6ekqbyuecOrmKSdXZi8r7LIq6SenF2pvG68xKudqKqdYq61ecytrWaunZbAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
