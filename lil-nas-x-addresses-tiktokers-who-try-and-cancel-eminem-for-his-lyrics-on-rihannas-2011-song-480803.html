Hot New Hip Hop says the ‚ÄúOld Town Road‚Äù rapper has become easily one of the most relatable stars to the younger crowd. He grew up with social media, has a firm understanding of how it works, and is also a platinum-certified artist already.</p><p>The outlet says the rapper recently exposed himself as having an ear for trolling as well. This was proven by his exchange with <a href=# rel=noopener>Tekashi 6ix9ine</a> amid rumors that the Tattle Tales artist had tried flirting with him in his direct messages.</p><p>Fast-forward to today, but first, it‚Äôs important to give context: as it was previously reported, TikTokers and older social media users were fighting online last week over <a href=# title="Fans Explain That Mariah Carey‚Äôs Memoir Will Spill News Eminem Fans Already Know About Their Short-Lived Romance"><strong>Eminem</strong></a> and whether or not he should be canceled for his 2011 song with Rihanna. As the story goes, TikTokers were unhappy with some of the artist‚Äôs lyrics, particularly on ‚ÄúLove The Way You Lie.‚Äù</p><p>Hot New Hip Hop and other outlets explained that what appeared to be the older generation came to bat for Eminem. Many people argued that the rapper was practically uncancelable at this point because people have been trying to end his career for literally decades.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wanna cancel eminem out of spite now <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/IehdeXCvH5</a></p><p>‚Äî yaoi godüçâ (@chairnoizes) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 2, 2021</a></p><p>Eminem fans argued that Marshall Mathers was too big to be canceled at this point, moreover, his history as an artist shows that he almost never backs down from a challenge. As most know, for years, critics, talking heads on TV, and other analysts tried justifying the cancelation of Eminem, but all they ever did was make him even more popular to the youth.</p><p>This was right around the time that ‚ÄúThe Way I Am‚Äù came out in which the rapper intelligently referenced the Columbine Massacre which many blamed on Marilyn Manson. The music video even featured Marilyn.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for what <a href=# title="Billie Eilish, Bon Iver, Lizzo, Lil Nas X Featuring Billy Ray Cyrus And More Get A Grammy Nomination For Record Of The Year"><strong>Lil Nas X</strong></a> has to say about it, the rapper took to his account to reference another video that laughed <a href=# rel=noopener>at the idea of canceling Eminem.</a> Lil Nas X mocked the video that came to the rapper‚Äôs defense including the way it used the backing track for ‚ÄúForgot About Dre.‚Äù</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecnrluusCsZLFlkZmxs7HSrJysZaSeuLW7yp6prGWnnbxuwNGyZJqmlGKworrCnqNmnZ2eu6a5jJ%2Bmq2WYnsBuuNiroJyrXaS7br7IoZinppGoenN8kGpkrKeenHp1hI9xZ2xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
