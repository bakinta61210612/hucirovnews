The company promoted the photo earlier this week, but the comments haven't slowed down yet.</p><p>"See how model and mum Ymre Stiekema stays fit and healthy with the Bugaboo Runner," the company posted on their <a href=#>Facebook page</a> on July 21. In the ad, Stiekema is wearing tiny black bottoms, a black and white bikini top (where's the sports bra!?), and is showing off her abs and toned legs. (Some Bugaboo strollers can be worth anywhere between $649 and $1,765.)</p><p>"Seriously why in the world would she be running in this? Horrible promotion!! Not gonna lie she's one fit mama but really?!!!" one commenter wrote. A second noted: "I hope she's running to mcdonalds. I'd rather not look like that! Far too skinny. I'm no model but that's not a great picture to show new mums. I like a real woman with wobbly bits!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Some women even got a kick out of the photo. "Are you kidding me? Who goes running like that? Haha," one wrote. Another joked: "So thaaaat's what I have been doing wrongâ€¦..I need to jog with my baby in a Bugaboo to get my beach body back."</p><p>Even so, some moms didn't see the problem. In fact, they called out others for putting it down, and even looked at the ad as inspiration.</p><p>"Fabulous idea but I bet the bugaboo is also a fabulous price that the majority of us women on maternity just cannot afford," one posted. Another woman added: "Hello she is not gonna run like this with a make up and fab looking hair! Perfectly shot picture! She is one hot mama! Stop being jealous and move! Simples!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKSopaNivLbA0Zqenpxdl8ZurtSgmJunn2LAtb7OpaOeql2WsW7Ax5qrZp6VlsG2vsSsZJuhm567qnnCpZidZZ2ksaa4jGtnam1iaoQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
