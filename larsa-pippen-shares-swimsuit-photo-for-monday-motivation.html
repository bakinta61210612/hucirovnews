Pippen, 49, shared a picture of herself lying on a yacht in a tiny black bikini, against a background of blue skies and sparkling ocean water. "Monday motivation ðŸ–¤," she captioned the post. "That is a lot of motivation there for sure, wow," a fan commented. How does she stay so fit and full of energy? Here are 5 ways the TV personality takes care of her health and fitness.</span></p><p><span>Pippen emphasizes the importance of both diet and fitness for health and wellbeing. "I've always had a passion for health and fitness," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I believe that your body is your temple and you must nurture it to get the most mileage from it. I receive tons of correspondence from mothers inquiring about my workout regimen. After having four children, I know how hard it is to get in shape. I was inspired to create a platform, Fitness 15, to help busy mothers achieve results without having to spend hours at the gym. Half of it is exercise, the other half is dieting. Eat right and teach your kids about healthy and clean eating! It all begins in the kitchen."</span></p><p><span>Pippen swears by squats to get her curvy physique. "I do squats almost every day," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "You don't need weights for that. You're just [using] your own body weight. I do 40 squats a set. If you incorporate weights into that then you wouldn't have to do so many. You would just do 12-15 repsâ€¦ I feel like for women, if you have strong legs, when you wear a dress you look so sexy. Not only that, it changes the way you walkâ€¦ It just changes the way you move."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_1841912794.jpg><p><span>Pippen advises that anyone wanting to get into shape be sensible about their goals and give themselves time for ultimate success. "Make sure the goals you set are realistic," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Oftentimes, we set ourselves up for disappointment by setting the bar too high. Start small and slowly increase your milestones, this way you have something to work towards."</span></p><p><span>Pippen's wellness mantra is simple but effectiveâ€”it's all about healthy habits and a good lifestyle. "When I feel my best, I'm working out consistently, I'm eating clean, I'm spending great time with my kids, I'm rocking my jewelry and I'm just doing the most basic things," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I feel like the most basic things I've learned make me the happiest."</span></p><p><span>Pippen gained a few pounds during the pandemic lockdowns, and couldn't care less. "Me and my kids work out together every day," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "We cook. We love to bake. My daughter loves to bake, so literally, I gained a few pounds baking with her every day. Lately I'm like, 'Oh my God, who cares?' I just have to live my best life. We're baking, we're working out together, we watch movies together. I feel like we've watched everything on TV. We're gonna start making our own movies sooner or later."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK2t0ayYZqiZpb2muoysn5qqlah6tMPIpqquoaRivam706hkn6eiYrqwusOasGaln6m2t63ToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
