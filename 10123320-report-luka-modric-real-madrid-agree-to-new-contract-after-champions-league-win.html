Modrić, per Cortegana, is keen to surpass that mark.</p><p>Kroos is not, as he <a href=# rel=noopener>announced on Saturday</a> that he will retire after the Euros this summer. Nacho's future at the club is currently unknown, while Cortegana reported that fullback Lucas Vázquez is set to sign a new deal and return to the club.</p><p>And then, of course, is the biggest piece of summer news for Real Madrid—the imminent signing of superstar forward Kylian Mbappé:</p>Fabrizio Romano <span class=acct>@FabrizioRomano</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>🚨⚪️ Real Madrid have prepared formal announcement for Kylian Mbappé next week.&lt;br>&lt;br>Kylian will then focus on the Euros and then start Real chapter in July.&lt;br>&lt;br>This won't change Rodrygo's future who is still planning to stay, same for Arda Güler and Endrick.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TurkishAirlines?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TurkishAirlines&lt;/a> ✈️🤝🏻 &lt;a href="https://t.co/CPdg5ktOF3">pic.twitter.com/CPdg5ktOF3&lt;/a></p><p>As for Modrić, his return keeps a veteran leader and experienced piece of midfield depth in place for Los Blancos, as they look to build upon a fantastic 2023-24 season that saw them win La Liga and Champions League. The UCL title has been claimed by Real Madrid more times than not since the 2013-14 season, with six triumphs in 11 years, an astonishing streak.</p><p>Modrić, 38, made 43 appearances between the two competitions this past season (21 starts), registering two goals and six assists. The future of Real Madrid's midfield is centered on superstar Jude Bellingham and players like Federico Valverde, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Eduardo Camavinga, but having Modrić available for at least one more year is a boon for Los Blancos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiAc3yMq5ypp6Kpeq3ByppkpqeUp7akedGemKVlnZaxs7XDZpigqpWaerW7jKecsGWTpLu1vsCcq2aZlqmys3nCoZimqJmku7R5y56YoK2VYsSqug%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
