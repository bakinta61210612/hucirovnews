While both of them have endured backlash, it looks like one organization is willing to forgive DaBaby, while still looking for an apology from Dave,’ TSR notes.</p><p>TSR continued and said: ‘If y’all recall, LGBTQ organizations offered to meet with DaBaby, and Dave Chappelle agreed to meet with Netflix employees after Dave joked about DaBaby’s involvement in a murder case compared to the sensitivity of the LGBTQ community. Since then, DaBaby has issued a public apology, and met with nine HIV awareness organizations to apologize as well. On the other hand, Dave said he is willing to meet with member of the community but will do so on his own terms.’</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</p><p>TSR said: ‘Gwendolyn D.
