They’re nasty. They’re funny. They would never be allowed on broadcast TV, and it’s some of the best material ever.”</p><p>Andrews added that she was very happy with the latest addition to the judges’ table: <strong><a href=#>Julianne Hough</a></strong>, whose fourth-judge status was announced on Thursday. “I loved having Julianne. She came on the season when I was on, and she was great,” Andrews <a href=#>gushed</a>. “The Houghs really put DWTS on the map. <strong><a href=#>Derek</a></strong>‘s amazing. Julianne is a sick dancer. Any way that they can make the show better and more exciting for the fans is amazing.”</p><p>Along with hosting the show, Andrews will tackle her biggest career move yet — as Fox Sports’ ace sideline reporter — a role which she <a href=#>controversially claimed from reigning reporter <strong>Pam Oliver</strong></a>. “This wasn’t in the curriculum,” the University of Florida alumni said of her broadcast journalism background. “This wasn’t in the textbook. It’s something you have to learn to deal with. Nothing is a shock anymore.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=344 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Erin Andrews interviewing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In July, Andrews called her new role as NFL’s A-team sideline reporter “a dream come true.” She <a href=#>added to ABC News</a>, “There’s nobody I’ve watched more over these past 15, 20 years than Pam Oliver, and what she did and the precedent she set. How she worked tirelessly day in and day out and really set the standard for women and sideline reporters and so much more than that. I can’t thank her enough for being a wonderful role model. This is not going to be easy for me.”</p><p>Accompanying Andrews’ meteoric rise to fame has been a healthy dose of public scrutiny. “I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong in my personal life, but now everybody is a judge and now with the Internet and social media, everybody has something to say,” she told Fox. “I have a fantastic support system with my family, my boyfriend [NHL player<strong> Jarret Stoll</strong>] and my friends, and they’re just like, ‘block that all out.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJyroZ5irq%2Bw0Z6urGWUlruktc2gZLChpJ16tbTEZqqtmaKoerOxx56Yq6uRocBurdGeZKeZo6nGbn6Pamtramg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
