She is the wife of a hilarious businessman who always makes us laugh when he has some camera time. She is the mother of two seemingly intelligent and fun kids. She’s a killer in the kitchen. She is the cousin<a href=#> of Teresa Giudice</a>. She is Kathy Wakile, and she has long since been one of our favorite housewives. She has a way of saying what is on everyone’s minds with appropriateness and tact, and she never fails to make us smile. She is the epitome of a mom, always in the kitchen trying to make sure her loved ones are fed, and she’s always looking out for everyone’s best interests. We might not see much of her this season – so far – in Jersey, but she’s got plenty of interesting things to discuss with us on Twitter; and we keep up.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“Gratitude Unlocks The Fullness Of Life”… Melanie Beattie<a href=#>#forevergrateful</a> ???????? @ Sithonia, Greece <a href=#>https://t.co/tueqKXdEBM</a></p><p>— Kathy Wakile (@KathyWakile) <a href=#>August 14, 2016</a></p><p><strong>The Truth in One Sentence&nbsp;</strong> I think that it is perfectly fine to want more out of life when you can get it, but I also think you have to learn to appreciate what you have when you are working so hard to get more out of life. Gratitude is very important. I bet there was once a time when all you wanted was what you have right now.</p><p>Thank You Lord, for such a Beautiful Day!! <a href=#>https://t.co/nuxZj5w2S9</a> — Kathy Wakile (@KathyWakile) <a href=#>August 13, 2016</a></p><p><strong>She Gives Thanks&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Is there anything better than a woman who is not afraid to share her faith in God on the internet and in public and not care what anyone else thinks? Nope; there is not. We love Kathy Wakile’s sweet nature and her simple pleasure in giving thanks where it is due.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The sweetest fruit is always the hardest to reach….

She knows how to give good advice without making anyone feel like they’re not doing enough; and that is a skill few have mastered.</p><p>Next month <a href=#>@richardwakile</a> & I will celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary-we spent our Honeymoon… <a href=#>https://t.co/h0Ywl44rUe</a> — Kathy Wakile (@KathyWakile) <a href=#>August 7, 2016</a></p><p><strong>She Knows the Value of Marriage&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Who doesn’t love a couple that has fun together, values their family and values their marriage? I’m sure they had times that they felt the need to work harder to make things work and that they wanted to give up, but they did not. I love that about them. They’re having fun, they’re loving life and they are appreciative.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>God is Great!! <a href=#>https://t.co/GRfN0JcIzz</a></p><p>— Kathy Wakile (@KathyWakile) <a href=#>July 26, 2016</a></p><p><strong>Yes, He Is&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And that is that.
