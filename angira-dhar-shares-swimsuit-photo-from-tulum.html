In a recent social media post the Indian actress shows off her incredible figure in a bathing suit while soaking up the sun in Mexico. Several of her Instagram followers commented on the sultry photo. "Cover of SI right there," one wrote. "Gorgeous," added another. How does the 35-year-old approach health and fitness? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/GettyImages-1239388404.jpg><p><span>Exercise is a priority for Angira. "I hit the gym, invariably. That's most accessible to me, more than a swimming pool or anywhere else," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hindustan Times</span></a><span>.&nbsp; The gym is my go-to place." Each week adults need 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity, according to the current </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.</span></a></p><p><span>Angira also loves to strike a post. "I do yoga, once in a while, but that's mostly for stretching," she added. There is a laundry list of reasons to do yoga, explains </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at least four years, gained less weight during middle adulthood," they said. "People who were overweight actually lost weight. Overall, those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs) compared with those who did not practice yoga. Researchers attributed this to mindfulness. Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/shutterstock_133223858.jpg><p><span>"I do not generally have a diet plan. I've never actually been on one. I try and eat healthy, as much as possible. I don't eat junk. I don't even like eating junk," Angira told Hindustan Times. She added that she relies "on eating healthy eating," and "regularly working out."</span></p><p><span>Another way Angira stays in shape? "I have a staircase in my house. That's how much exercise I like to do at home, just going up and down the staircase," she said. "I'd rather walk from point A to point B, provided it's walking distance, instead of taking a car. These are the little things I incorporate into my daily life. I believe these little things amount to staying healthy and active."</span></p><p><span>"I definitely prefer outdoor activities to indoors, because I never realize the amount I have worked out being outdoors. It's so much fun being out in the open. It's much better than being indoors. I do gym, quite regularly, but I would always select an outdoor activity like trekking, swimming or running. Given a choice, I prefer outdoor activities more," Angira told Hindustan Ties.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"My favorite physical activities are swimming and trekking. If I can find a good partner, I would love to play table tennis too. These are my go-to physical activities, apart from the gym," Angira revealed to Hindustan Times.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKK6xqKpmmWUna6zedKhmKudo2LAuLXMrKyirF2ltbDAzmadq6edYsG2uNSmZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
