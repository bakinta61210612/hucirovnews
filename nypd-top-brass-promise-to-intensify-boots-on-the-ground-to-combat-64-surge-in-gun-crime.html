mission to crack down on fraudulent license plates if there are no shootings this summer.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Some may look at that and say that’s unrealistic, but I assure you that in this agency – from every cop on the street to civilian members to myself and everyone in between – day and night, all through the day, thinks about how to keep people safe,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harrison said that fake plates have been connected to 33 shootings and 60 other incidents where shots were fired. ‘Just this week we had a shooting in Southeast Queens where the individuals were in a car with a fraudulent plate,’ Shea added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harrison called the increase in fake plates a ‘by-product’ of pandemic lockdowns because criminals could exploit the fact that the Department of Motor Vehicles was inundated with guests and operating under limited hours.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To approach this, the NYPD plans to scan online marketplaces to spot fake plates and cops have been trained to tell the differences between real license plates.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mayor de Blasio called the reasons for the uptick in crimes ‘a perfect storm of negative factors’ that is playing out in cities across the country.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We will turn it around,’ he said. ‘I think it is a mistake to say here is our exact metrical pattern. What I can tell you is gun arrests have been strong, the cooperation with the community is improving all the time, the investments in the community are making an impact, the courts are coming back, the economy is coming back.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m very confident about where we’re going, but I still think it’s gonna take time to know exactly how it’s gonna play out.’</p><img
