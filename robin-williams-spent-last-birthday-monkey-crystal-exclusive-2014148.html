And now well-known screen monkey <strong>Crystal</strong>, who costarred with Williams in the three&nbsp;Night at the Museum films, is sharing fond memories (through her trainer <strong>Tom Gunderson</strong>) of their last encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>In his penultimate <a href=#>Instagram picture</a>, Williams posed with his furry friend on his 63rd birthday on July 21, writing, “Happy Birthday to me! A visit from one of my favorite leading ladies, Crystal.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Crystal’s trainer Tom Gunderson remembered the day well, “As we were nearing the end of filming Night at the Museum 3, I mentioned that Crystal and I would be doing a film project in the Bay Area in July, and he invited me to contact him,” Gunderson recalls to Us. “Robin generously made time to see us on his birthday.”</p><p>Not only did the late comedian and actor meet up with Crystal on his birthday, but he also loved spending time with her on the movie’s set.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>”Robin was incredibly engaging with Crystal on all three movies,” Gunderson continued. “It is not often that an actor of his caliber engages an animal like that. He was always a very giving, kind, and thoughtful person. He will forever be loved and missed. The world is a dimmer place without him.”</p><p>In fact, in April the actor posed in full costume as Teddy Roosevelt with his monkey friend, <a href=#>captioning the photo</a>, “Hanging with my pal, Crystal, on the set of NATM3.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmompmjeri1y6WgmqWjYsCxsc2tZKWZo6l6o7XRrZ%2BdmaliurC6yp6wZpuirsC1rctmnLGbnKrAqsLEZmlpaWRmgXk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
