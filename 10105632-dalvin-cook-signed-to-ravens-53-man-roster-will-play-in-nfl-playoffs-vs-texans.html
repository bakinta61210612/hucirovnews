His 3.2 yards per tote were more than a yard worse than his previous career-low mark of 4.4 yards per carry set in 2022.</p><p>Although there are legitimate questions regarding whether Cook has anything left in the tank, the Ravens bet on the notion that he will be able to be effective in their system.</p><p>The Ravens have dealt with some major injury issues in their backfield this season, as starting running back J.K. Dobbins was lost for the year in Week 1, and electric rookie Keaton Mitchell suffered a season-ending injury in December.</p><p>That left Baltimore with only Gus Edwards and Justice Hill at running back, and it prompted them to bring in Cook as depth and insurance.</p><p>Edwards has been the Ravens' top option out of the backfield this season, rushing for 810 yards and a career-high 13 touchdowns. Hill rushed for 387 yards and three scores, and he was a reliable pass-catching option for quarterback Lamar Jackson, reeling in 28 receptions for 206 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>Since Edwards and Hill have clearly defined roles, all signs point toward the Ravens continuing to deploy them in the same manner during the playoffs.</p><p>That means the opportunities may not be plentiful for Cook, but having him on hand should benefit the team in case Edwards or Hill get banged up, or they need a rest at some point in Saturday's pivotal contest.</p><p>If the top-seeded Ravens manage to beat the Texans, they will host the AFC Championship Game against either the Buffalo Bills or Kansas City Chiefs, which would put them one win away from Cook playing in his first Super Bowl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqDdH6MnZilrpmjeqS7zqRkrKGXo7KledOoZKuZppq7tHmUbGSmmZ5iv7C%2F056pZq%2BZobluvMuasGahnmK7p7iMqaOasZ%2Bbs7R51axkrZ2olru0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
