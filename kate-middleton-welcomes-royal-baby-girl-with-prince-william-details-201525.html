After much anticipation, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a>, welcomed their second child together — a daughter named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana — in Paddington, London on Saturday, May 2.</p><p><strong>11:00 a.m. GMT:</strong> Kensington Palace announced the birth through Twitter first, just a few hours after Middleton <a href=#>went into labor</a>&nbsp;and was admitted to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital at around 6:00 a.m. local time. Not long before the announcement, a palace spokesperson told Us her <a href=#>labor was "progressing normally."</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a daughter at 8.34am.</p><p>— Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) <a href=#>May 2, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The baby weighs 8lbs 3oz.

"I've been doing this for 25 years," he told Us.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>2:15 p.m. GMT:</strong> Prior to the birth, royal baby watchers had been placing bets for weeks on what name the second-time parents might choose. The <a href=#>top name for a girl</a>, as revealed by the UK's Coral betting service, is Alice, with a 5 to 4 ratio.</p><p><strong>12:30 p.m. GMT:</strong>&nbsp;A source tells Us Weekly the new parents are&nbsp;<a href=#>"happy" and "relaxed."</a>&nbsp;They're also incredibly loved, as evidenced by the&nbsp;<a href=#>outpouring of love and well wishes</a>&nbsp;sent their way after the baby's birth.</p><p><strong>12:40 p.m. GMT:</strong> In keeping with tradition, the royal family formally announced the new princess <a href=#>on a gold easel</a> in front of Buckingham Palace.

Twenty-five minutes later, father and son returned <a href=#>in matching outfits</a> — white collared shirts and blue sweaters — so <a href=#>George could meet his new little sister</a>, who <a href=#>shares a birthday</a> with David Beckham and The Rock, among others.</p><p><strong>5:30 p.m. GMT:</strong> Prince George left through a back door and returned home ahead of his parents' departure from the hospital. According to Kensington Palace, the royal couple and their newborn daughter will be leaving the Lindo Wing after 6:30 p.m. local time.</p><p>Middleton, 33, and Prince William, 32, announced <a href=#>in September 2014</a> that their son <strong>Prince George </strong>was going to be a big brother. After a trip to NYC, a parade of fab maternity outfits, and more, the royal baby prep officially began on April 14 <a href=#>as parking restrictions</a> were posted outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital, the very same wing where Prince George was born in July 2013.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source tells<strong> <a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> that the couple will next travel back to their Anmer Hall home in Norfolk.

The Palace isn't commenting on when she will return to public engagements. The insider notes: "As you’d expect with having two very young children, her focus will be on the family during the summer."</p><p>On Sunday, the little <a href=#>princess received visits</a> from Prince Charles, Pippa Middleton, Carole and Michael Middleton, and more. Prince Harry released a statement saying his niece <a href=#>is "absolutely beautiful."</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKKarJViuqqww6WcraeeYsSmuMKopJ6rXae8uq3LZpmamqlitKq%2By2auoqyYYr2ztc2cnGavmaG5qq3MZpuerJGeubR5kWlobmpl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
