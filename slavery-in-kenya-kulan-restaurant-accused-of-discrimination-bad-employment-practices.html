This started when a friend got a position and prompted me to dine there.</p><p>The Somali owner restaurant employs Kenyans who are subtly discriminated. Small things in the work place are key for a good working environment.</p><p>My friend narrated of how this silent discrimination happens.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/img_20191229_1233286373848344508758745.jpg width=1228 height=1049 sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>My friend who left employment there recently stated the below in 21 points:</p><li>Somali employees are treated differently from the other Kenyans.</li><li>Somali employees are bosses in their own right, they are in charge of every dept and a Somali must be present for anything to take place.</li><li>This is not so wrong if merit and experience were the criteria but not so.</li><li>A certified chef in the kitchen has to take instructions from Somali employees most who have no qualifications in culinary and some very little post-primary education. In short, a certified cook takes instructions from any Somali be it the cashier, store keeper or the kitchen supervisor all who are not chefs by any standard.</li><li>This is very unprofessional and a huge demotivator to serious professional.</li><li>Imagine having to follow an order from some whose rank is granted by ethnicity.</li><li>The waiters are in the same dilemma and so are the rest of Kenyan staff.</li><li>There is no disciplinary action against Somali misconduct.</li><li>They are frequently late and maybe abusive and aggressive towards other staff.</li><li>They have been cases of Kenyans facing abusive language and no action is taken.</li><li>Kenyans often resign due to frustration and abusive language.</li><li>The staff are employed on contract and thus dismissal is in the spot. The fight is your wits against the word of a Somali. As such the Kenyans fear the Somalis as they want to keep there Job.</li><li>There has been a case of a Somali staff hurling a knife as he didn’t like how he was served by fellow staff. This is how abbrasive things can be at Kulan.</li><li>The employer has no concern for staff welfare and consistently delays salary causing fights with landlords and caretakers. Pleas are not heeded</li><li>The owners also have a white friend by the name Nick who is known to be abusive to staff and smokes in the premises, causing discomfort to the staff</li><li>The Kenyan staff are provided for a meal of ugali, sukuma for lunch and tea and bread.</li><li>The Somali can, however, enjoy any meal from the menu at any time for free, this is another case of subtle discrimination. The staff can’t even have water from a glass, just tap water is allowed using plastic cups.</li><li>There NHIF and NSSF often go unpaid despite it being deducted and essential for healthcare. Lea is most likely not remitted (not sure).</li><li>This is just a snippet of what my friend who recently left narrated to me. More could be happening and I hope authorities investigate.</li><li>If you visit you will clearly see what I talk about, demotivated people in a toxic environment.</li><li>Please reach out to current and former staff and they will collaborate this.</li><p>Slavery In Kenya: <a href=#>Click to READ MORE</a></p><p><strong>We reach out to former and current staff.
