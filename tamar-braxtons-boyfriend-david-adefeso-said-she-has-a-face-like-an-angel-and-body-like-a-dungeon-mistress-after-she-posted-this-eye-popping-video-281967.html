Tamar made sure she showed off her perky booty by twerking.</p><p>The actress captioned the video: “The former host The From the beach to the stage at the James night center💪🏾Meet me there!! I got something special for u Miami ✨.”</p><p>David Adefeso, who is Tamar’s boyfriend, was salivating over the raunchy clip and had this to say: “Face like an angel❤️❤️❤️; body like a #dungeonmistress🔥🔥🔥….can’t wait to see the show tonite👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏿🙏🏿🔥🔥❤️❤️”</p><p>One fan replied: “Please marry me @tamarbraxton .!!!!!! Now, I’m already married and have been married for 16 years but, if you’ll take my hand, I’ll leave my husband . 😂😂😂😂. Real bodies look so fukn good. Go, girl!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌Who ain’t a bad bihh???? Push on through TayTay 😍What you been eating sis?? Give me the meal pl.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BxSxDhzF6xn/</p><p>Another supporter explained: “Listen!!!

Bluebird made us a lil sad sis. Great album but we need that turn-up, Tamar.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BxYPlcblWNg/</p><p>This critic wrote: “Where them church clothes. Girl, put some clothes on please, trashy.”</p><p>Kandi recently defended Tamar who opted not to attend her niece’s funeral because she was emotionally drained: “All the performers in my Dungeon party were amazing but I want to say a special thanks to @tamarbraxton! She was phenomenal! Tamar experienced a death in the family this week & I saw a few people have decided to shame her for performing because they feel that she should not be doing anything at this time. YOU CAN NOT TELL PEOPLE HOW TO GRIEVE. Some people need to work or stay active to stop theirselves from falling apart. Believe me I know!”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Tamar is trying to live her best life regardless of what the critics are saying about her different choices. Her honesty is refreshing.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklrqivoybqZqwpKS7tHnBqLCfqpmau6V5w5qtopxdlrGmssSspmarkZ6xbr%2FHnmShmaNirm6ywJycZqSZoLJurc1mmKeflaF6orrDZpmonKliuaq3xGaYZpylo7Smu81mpKKrpKeytL%2BMmp2tnaJiwKmxjKmmrKyVmXq1tMisZJ6xlWK9sLzPoqWgZaaesaa7jGtvanFmbHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
