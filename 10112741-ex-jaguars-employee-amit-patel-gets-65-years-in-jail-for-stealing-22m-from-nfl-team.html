"We trusted him. We worked with him. We broke bread with him. We went through a pandemic and the highs and lows of the NFL with him. He betrayed us.</p><p>"We take no joy in his punishment. Make no mistake, Amit broke our hearts."</p><p>The Jaguars also clarified that Patel was the only employee to participate in these activities and he had no inside access to football information.</p><p>DiRocco noted Patel oversaw the Jaguars' virtual credit card program and stole more than $22 million from the team over the course of 3.5 years. Court documents revealed he transferred approximately $20 million to FanDuel and $1 million to DraftKings while also using some of the money on things such as Apple products and private jet travel.</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>David Purdum</a> reported in December that Patel "was a high-volume, high-stakes daily fantasy sports player known for racking up big losses."</p><p>One daily fantasy player told Purdum that Patel, who played under the username "ParlayPicker," was "the biggest loser ever on FanDuel," with another person saying "he was legendarily bad."</p><p>The NFL prohibits team and league employees from gambling on sports or participating in daily fantasy.</p><p>According to DiRocco, Patel has received treatment and attended Gamblers Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after he was diagnosed with a gambling disorder in March 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWeEdX2Mnq9mopGcwqK%2B0macpqicpMamsYyapKKsXaWutbHLZp6erKNig3Z52J6Yq6tdnrtutsCio2aen6d6tMDEmqOippdif3O5jJ%2BpqKVdo7OtedOemKY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
