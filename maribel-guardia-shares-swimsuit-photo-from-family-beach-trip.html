She then began a career in the entertainment industry. Guardia starred in shows like </span><i><span>Tu y yo</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Una familia con suerte. </span></i><span>Guardia is also a singer and TV host. She's currently enjoying a vacation in the Bahamas, and shared a set of swimsuit photos on Instagram. Guardia captioned the post, "</span><span>AND THE BEAUTIFUL OF THIS IS LIFE. COSER SUENOS, BORDAR STORIES AND POWER TO UNLEASH. THE KNOTS OF OUR DAYS."</span> <span>How does she stay so fit? </span><span>Read on to see 5 ways Maribel Guardia stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><p><span>Guardia is an avid dancer. She shares a lot of posts on Instagram of herself dancing. Guardia shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this video</span></a><span> of herself dancing on stage. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Prudential</span></a><span> reports that dance has a lot of health benefits. "The movements associated with dance can increase flexibility and reduce stiffness. Don't over-exert yourself though â€“ even the simple stretches associated with dancing can help ease joint pain and any soreness from other more strenuous exercises."</span></p><p><span>Guardia makes sure to eat healthy, and avoids unhealthy foods as much as she can. She shared some of her secrets </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>in an interview</span></a><span>. One of Guardia's secrets is carrying healthy options with her. "I try to carry healthy things in the bag, so I don't have to eat filthy things like chips, candy and so on."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/shutterstock_1860537601.jpg><p><span>Guardia is a big believer in balance when it comes to her diet. Especially when it comes to carbohydrates. In the same interview, Guardia says that she limits carbs during most of the week, and has one day where she indulges. "When I eat a tortilla in the morning, for the rest of the day I don't eat another one and I avoid bread," she explained. "On Sundays I eat everything: pizza, hamburgers, desserts."</span></p><p><span>Guardia likes to spend time outside. One thing she likes to do is go on hikes. She shared</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> these photos and videos</span></a><span> on Instagram of herself hiking in Costa Rica. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span> states that hiking has a lot of benefits, including helping people with their sleep. "If you struggle to get a good night's sleep, then a hike might be beneficial. Exposure to vitamin D can help control your wake-sleep cycle. And being outside and exercising will also raise your body's temperature, so when your internal temperature goes back down, it can lull you into sleep."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Guardia makes sure to stretch, and shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this photo</span></a><span> of herself working out on Instagram. She captioned the post, "</span><span>Stretch your body, your mind and your heart." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Mayo Clinic</span></a><span> states that stretching has a lot of benefits. "</span><span>However, research has shown that stretching can help improve flexibility, and, as a result, the range of motion of your joints. Better flexibility may: Improve your performance in physical activities. Decrease your risk of injuries. Help your joints move through their full range of motion. Increase muscle blood flow. Enable your muscles to work most effectively. Improve your ability to do daily activities."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK6t0aKZnqRdnMKivsOimGarmJa%2Fpr%2BMrK6ipaOqtrV5z6Gmraddm7%2BwuYyfmKahnK56o7HAnJ9mrKKevXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
