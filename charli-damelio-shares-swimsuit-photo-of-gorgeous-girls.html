In a recent social media post the TikTok and reality star shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit alongside pal GiaNina Paolantonio while vacationing with a group of friends at Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. "What a time lol," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps. "Gorgeous Girls," commented one of her millions of followers. How does the young celebrity approach health and fitness? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Charli, her sister, and mother Heidi regularly train with Ben Bruno. In a recent TikTok video, they do a variety of strength and weight training exercises. Working out with others is a great way to keep yourself accountable and make exercise fun.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the main ways Charli burns calories is by dancing. "You know, dance wasn't something that I found fun anymore. It was something that was more just, I did to do it and, you know, it was over when it was over and I didn't look forward to it anymore. And I think with Dancing With the Stars every week, it's like, you know, I'm hearing from other people that I finally look like I'm having fun," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "I look happy and I'm feeling, kind of, those same things that I used to feel when I was younger, dancing, that I kind of lost and thought that I wouldn't find again," she said. "Just because it had been so long without being that excited for performance. To be able to do that again is really a full circle moment for me and just makes me really happy." Dancing is a great workout for many reasons. Not only does it build strength and promote flexibility, but helps you lose weight and even promotes cardiovascular function. A 2016 study published in the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>American Journal of Preventive Medicine </span></a><span>determined that people who engaged in moderate-intensity dancing were 46 percent less likely to develop heart disease or die from it than non-dancers. In comparison, moderate-intensity walkers were just 25 percent less likely to suffer heart health issues.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/shutterstock_2392174825.jpg><p><span>Charli engages in the occasional cheat meal. Her go-to? Dunkin Donuts, who she ended up partnering with. "The Dunkin Donuts collaboration came about after a lot of free promotion. For a while, everyone thought I was getting paid. But I was not. I just shamelessly promoted and promoted because I really wanted to work with them. And then they finally gave me the opportunity and I immediately took it," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Forbes</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Charli loves coffee so much, she has "two of my own drinks on the menu and sold-out cold brew nationwide" at Dunkin," she told Forbes. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span>, there are several benefits of drinking coffee in moderation. "It </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>acts on your brain</span></a><span> to improve memory, mood, reaction times, and mental function," they say, citing a s</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>tudy</span></a><span> finding that caffeine can improve endurance and performance during exercise. It is also antioxidant-rich, can ward off diabetes, prevent neurologic disease, lower cancer risk, and ward off depression, they point out.</span></p><p><span>Charli is also a walker. On Valentine's Day she took a long walk on the beach with her boyfriend, Landon Barker. Going for a daily walk can be a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKS0wKujomWUlrqmuMioZKygkaeytHnSsKCmq6WewW68x6irqGWfm3qou9GgnKito2K0qr7LrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
