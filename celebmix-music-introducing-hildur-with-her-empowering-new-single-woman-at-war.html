We now introduce you to rising Icelandic pop artist Hildur, who has recently released her empowering new single ‘Woman At War.’</p><p>The single is a stirring, equality-driven and encouraging anthem for strong women, with the empowering lyrics conveying a powerful message, while also maintaining a strong rhythm throughout, showcasing Hildur’s captivating vocals. When speaking about ‘Woman At War,’ Hildur explains:</p><p>“‘Woman At War’ is a song to honour all the strong women I know that have fought many battles and are tired – tired of always having to put up a fight, tired of putting in all the efforts but not seeing the situation change, tired of having to fight the same fight again and again, tired of being labelled angry when they really are just fighting for equal rights. I had experienced this feeling again and again and I wanted to try to put that exact feeling into a song. However, this song is not about giving up. It has hope. It conveys understanding that this is what the situation looks like right now and it’s okay to be overwhelmed by it and want to give up at times, because the beautiful thing is that all the women I know that have hit this wall, myself included, somehow find the strength in them to continue and return fighting strong, again.”</p><p>CelebMix had the opportunity to speak with Hildur about her new single ‘Women At War,’ her upcoming EP and much more.</p><p><strong>CelebMix love both your new track ‘Woman At War’ and the meaning behind the track. How does it feel to have the new single released?</strong></p><p>“Thank you! I’m very happy with this song. It feels really close to my heart. It was quite hard to write it though, it’s not easy creating a pop song that involves thoughts about gender equality! But I think a lot of women can strongly relate to this song and that makes me so happy.”</p><p></p><p><strong>This is a track taken off your upcoming EP, which is due to be released in the early summer. What can be expected from the EP? Will it follow one music genre in particular or will it be a mixture of genres?</strong></p><p>“It’s pop with a message. I was intrigued to write music about other feelings than love and some of the matters quite heavy, like anxiety or self-confidence issues. I think the EP has a very broad and colourful sound that is fresh and thoughtful. It’s most electronic indie pop, but with a twist I would say.”</p><p><strong>How did you discover your love for music?</strong></p><p>“I started stealing CD’s from my teen sister’s room when I was about six years old. She had good music taste and I would just listen to all her CD’s when she was not at home – even the ones with the weirdest covers (I remember a Radiohead CD specifically). My dad also introduced me to The Beatles and I think I got fascinated by the hooky melodies very quickly. But most of all, I just loved to sing all the time.”</p><p><strong>Apart from the release of your upcoming EP, what else have you got lined up music-wise for the remainder of the year?</strong></p><p>“I’m also a song-writer, so am quite busy with writing for other artists. I really enjoy that too, stepping out of my character and sound for a moment. Otherwise, I’ve started writing new music for my first full length album and I’ve just started playing the cello again, which I studied as a child. That has been challenging but fun! Who knows if there’s going to be some cello mood on the next album?”</p><p><strong>Finally, do you have a message for those who support you?</strong></p><p>“I’m thank for each and every person that takes time to listen to my songs. I hope they inspire you in some way! Also, don’t hesitate to follow your dreams – it’s almost never easy, but always worth it!”</p><p>‘Woman At War’ follows on from her previous single ‘1993.’ Both singles are taken from her upcoming EP, titled ‘Intuition,’ which is set for release in the early summer – we can’t wait to hear it!</p><p>Her track ‘I’ll Walk With You’ scooped the award for ‘Pop Song of the Year’ at the Icelandic Music Awards in 2017 and was also nominated as ‘Newcomer of the Year’ in the same year and she is definitely one to watch out for!</p><p>Hildur is more than just a singer – she is a song-writer, lyricist and professionally trained classical cellist. She chooses to use her platform wisely – taking the lead for gender equality, which is noticeable in her music, image and team she works with. Being a natural storyteller is embodied into everything she does, including her music.</p><p>‘Woman At War’ is now available to purchase from iTunes <a href=#>by clicking here</a>.
