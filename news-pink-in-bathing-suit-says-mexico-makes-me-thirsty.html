"I try to eat really healthy most of the time. When I'm not on tour, I've done the vegan thing, although I sometimes eat chicken and fish," she told Fitness. "<span>A healthy diet is rich in fiber, whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, 'good' or unsaturated fats, and omega-3 fatty acids. These dietary components turn down inflammation, which can damage tissue, joints, artery walls, and organs. Going easy on processed foods is another element of healthy eating. Sweets, foods made with highly refined grains, and sugar-sweetened beverages can cause spikes in blood sugar that can lead to early hunger. High blood sugar is linked to the development of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and even dementia," says <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Harvard Health</a>.</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/GettyImages-1318676284.jpg><p><span>Pink understands that to fuel her performances, she needs to eat more. "I eat a lot [on tour], because I work out four and a half hours a day: a two-hour show, plus yoga, cardio and a rig check with the flying apparatuses," she explains to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Food and Wine</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Pink is incredibly active when she is not working. A few of her favorite hobbies include biking, tennis, and wake surfing. "I always wondered why God gave me thunder thighs. It's cause he knew I'd use them," she captioned this photo on Instagram.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Pink has been working out with fitness coach Jeanette Jenkins for many years. "Alecia is one of the hardest working women I've ever met," Jeanette said about Pink in this </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram caption</span></a><span>. "When we first started training she was shooting a movie, recording a new album, learning how to be a new mom, working on getting her body back into top condition so she could deliver her fans an incredible tour." The two do a lot of weight and strength training together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Pink is also devoted to yoga. She keeps her body strong from practicing hardcore poses, like crow pose. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In this video</span></a><span> she holds up her child as she perfectly executes the move. There are so many benefits to yoga, according to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>American Osteopathic Association</span></a><span>. They include increased flexibility, increased muscle strength and tone, improved respiration, energy and vitality, maintaining a balanced metabolism, weight reduction, cardio and circulatory health, improved athletic performance, and protection from injury.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkqaGeoHqquoybmK2gmaO0br%2FUoqtmq5GuwG65xLGgnKddoq6ssdJmpJ5lpJ22s7%2FTsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
