This was streamed online thanks to iHeartRadio, so Glamberts&nbsp;around the world were able to watch! All the songs performed were from The Original High,&nbsp;except ‘Whataya Want From Me‘&nbsp; from For Your Entertainment. &nbsp;</p><p>There were two major reasons&nbsp;that made this performance so special to us. &nbsp;One was&nbsp;the fact that we were able to listen to all the new songs live for the first time,&nbsp;and second was the fact that Adam took the time to talk to his fans. &nbsp;Don’t you agree?</p><p></p><h3><strong>3. Good Morning America (6/19)</strong></h3><p>During this performance Adam sang ‘Ghost Town’, ‘The Original High’ and ‘Whataya Want From Me.’ He even&nbsp;sang an extra song (‘Evil In The Night’)&nbsp;which didn’t air live, but you can watch it on the second clip below!</p><p>https://youtu.be/lMqbMBLLX2c</p><p></p><h3><strong>4. Rock in Rio (9/18)</strong></h3><p>Rock in Rio was a performance that was also streamed live. &nbsp;During this set Adam sang&nbsp;with Queen, and they closed&nbsp;the show! &nbsp;This was the first time Queen performed&nbsp;at&nbsp;the festival&nbsp;since singing with Freddie Mercury back in 1985, 30 years ago.</p><p>During this performance, Adam even got to sing a “rock” version of his single ‘Ghost Town’ with Queen.</p><p>https://youtu.be/mp2SjLwiJuY?list=PLVB1hnGUslGuRyj9FT6AZ_WA2pztBwMPA</p><h3><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Ghost Town’ on the Today Show (10/7)</strong></h3><p>Ending our list is Adam’s performance on the Today Show. &nbsp;Before he sings ‘Ghost Town’ we learn that his latest&nbsp;album&nbsp;The Original High debuted at #3 on the Billboard charts. &nbsp;Yay&nbsp;Adam! &nbsp;We also have to admit, he really knows how to work that hat.</p><p>https://youtu.be/lTFr1Xj6DQ8</p><p><strong>Was there a performance we missed? &nbsp;Do you have a different&nbsp;top 5 list of Adam Lambert performances? &nbsp;Comment below or let us know on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kgm6tw5qkZqSRoq%2BmvtOsZJudo6l6sbHRn6arpZGjsKa%2FjGtnam1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
