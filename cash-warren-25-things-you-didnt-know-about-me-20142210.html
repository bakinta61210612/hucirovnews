I accidentally stumbled upon an emu farm in high school…don’t ask.</p><p>2. I started <a href=#>Pair of Thieves</a> with my two buddies, <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>David</strong>, because we hate drunk socks. Our socks can drink anyone under the table.</p><p>3. I can learn a new sport in about 6 min. Seriously, give me a Quidditch stick!</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood's Hottest Football Fans</a></p><p>4. I used to take three showers a day, until I got my first water bill.</p><p>5. I can't grow a real beard. Actually, my beard is just a really pathetic interpretation of a beard.</p><p>6. I will try anything once.</p><p>7. I speak French. At least I did when I had to convince my wife to marry me.</p><p>PHOTOS: Celebrity Weddings 2014</p><p>8. I went to Yale and was in a secret society (shhh). Still don’t know how I got in.</p><p>9. My mom lives in the South of France in a house that’s over 1,000 years old.</p><p>10. My dad played basketball at UCLA and was inducted into the NCAA Hall of Fame.</p><p>11. In the 7th grade, I started a rap group with my friend<strong> Beau Dozier</strong> and, fortunately, no one cared.</p><p>12. I won the basketball state championship as a senior in high school. Having<strong> Baron Davis</strong> as a teammate may have helped a little.</p><p>13. I’m a glass half full kind of guy, even when the cup is completely empty.</p><p>14. I will order four desserts without flinching.</p><p>15. I get my car washed like four times a year (try to catch me riding dirty!).</p><p>16. I’d rather have a bad idea with good timing, than have a good idea with bad timing.</p><p>17. Monotony is death for me, so I often jump before looking.</p><p>18. I let my daughters paint my nails so I can watch sports without them complaining.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Stars' Fav Beauty Products</a></p><p>19. I know what I don’t know, and don’t pretend otherwise.</p><p>20. I’d rather walk than sit in traffic.</p><p>21. I am not scared to make a mistake.</p><p>22. I wish my daughters were always as nice to me as they are when I walk in the door after work.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>23. I am so relieved that I didn’t grow up with social media and camera phones.</p><p>24. I firmly believe that thoughts beget words which beget actions.</p><p>25. I am the luckiest SOB in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqaq5hixKK%2B0Z6lZmplYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbXDp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWdmnpzfJBtaWtpYA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
