He served as the backbone for a unit that helped the program win back-to-back national championships in 1974 and 1975, his junior and senior seasons.</p><p>His play in 1975 helped him earn Consensus All-American honors alongside the likes of Ohio State's Archie Griffin as well as teammates Lee Roy Selmon and Dewey Selmon.</p><p>Elrod moved on to the NFL, where the Kansas City Chiefs selected him in the fifth round of the 1976 draft.</p><p>The Tennessee native played four seasons at the pro level, three in Kansas City and one with the Houston Oilers. He made 40 appearances, including five starts.</p><p>In 2012, he explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Haisten</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;Tulsa World&nbsp;that his football career left him with "great memories and constant pain," including shoulder and hip problems. He'd previously told the outlet he wouldn't have let a son play football because of the lingering effects.</p><p>"I love the game," Elrod said in 1998. " ... But it's a brutal game."</p><p>But even the health issues couldn't keep him away from Sooners games.
