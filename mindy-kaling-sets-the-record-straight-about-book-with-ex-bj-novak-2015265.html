Novak</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>The Mindy and B.J. Project is not quite what fans think. <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> took to Twitter and Instagram on Tuesday, May 26, to set the record straight on the upcoming book she is working on with her ex-boyfriend<strong> B.J. Novak</strong>.</p><p>The FOX-turned-Hulu star, 35, shot down rumors that she and Novak, also 35, are writing a tell-all book about their relationship, but confirmed that something is in the works.</p><p>"Many of you asked about a book that my friend BJ and I are working on," <a href=#>Kaling wrote in an Instagram caption</a>. "I heard somewhere it was a tell-all which I actually found exciting, because that sounds sexy and I grew up looking like a little fat boy."&nbsp;</p><p>"But it's not a tell-all," the Mindy Project star continued. "What I CAN tell you it will be super cool and funny and even better than that. For now we are researching."&nbsp;</p><p>"I swear I'm not trying to be mysterious! We are just starting work on it. Here is a cool pic of us working at my house," she added, referencing the shot she shared of children's book characters Frog and Toad.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rumor spread last week that the two Office alums were finally going to detail their complicated romantic history in a memoir. Kaling and Novak were in a relationship at one point during the filming of their NBC comedy, but split and reconciled multiple times as they remained friends.&nbsp;</p><p>"I will freely admit: My relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell," <a href=#>she told InStyle in a cover story interview</a> earlier this month. "He is not my boyfriend, but he is not my best friend. I guess you could describe our relationship as a 'romantically charged camaraderie with loud arguments,' but I donâ€™t think Facebook would accept this as a new status."</p><p>Kaling's new tome with Novak will likely be her third published book. She made her official debut with 2011's Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (and Other Concerns) and will release her second book, Why Not Me?, this coming September.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpqCnnKliuKK4yKeeZquVqcBuwMeeZKudk6S%2FpXnSramaoZedwW6twaisrWWSpLysedaiq6Flla16o7aMp6avmZtif3F9lGttbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
