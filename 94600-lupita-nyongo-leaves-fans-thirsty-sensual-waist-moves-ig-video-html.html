Never miss important updates!</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>Hollywood starlet Lupita Nyong'o is known for her ebony skin, athletic body, magnificent voice and talent in acting.</p><p class=align-left>But there is one more character trait she has that a lot of her fans knew nothing about.</p><p class=align-left>Lupita can dance... and not just dance, she can whine her wasp-like waist better than a Jamaican woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b53aa24d7cd6ac26.jpg><p class=align-left>Just recently, a new dance challenge dubbed #Jorochallenge popped up in everyone's Instagram timeline including the actress's.</p><p class=align-left>And she saw women getting their whine on as they balanced objects on their heads.</p><p class=align-left>So the dark skin beauty thought to herself, "Shouldn't I be part of it too?"</p><p class=align-left>Then, Lupita got to work and put to shame nearly everyone who participated in the challenge. <a href=# rel=noopener>The beauty</a> recorded herself doing her thing and she started off by placing what looked like a large orange on her head.</p><p class=align-left>Then, clad in a pretty crop top and tiny wrap, Lupita started winding her waist as she turned slowly.</p><p class=align-left>She took Instagram users by surprise and hypnotised each person who viewed her clip. Honestly, it is quite refreshing to see the thespian smile again. Not too long ago, she lost her friend, confidant and colleague Chadwick Boseman.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel=noopener>The actress</a> on Wednesday, September 8, afternoon joined the world in remembering the late actor with a moving tribute.</p><p class=align-left>Taking to her Facebook account, Lupita, who played Nakia in the Marvel film <i>Black Panther</i>, shared a photo of herself with Chadwick all happy, followed by a long note honouring the actor's memory.</p><p class=align-left>Lupita said it is hard to <a href=# rel=noopener>believe the actor is gone</a> and that she will live to remember him forever for his amazing personality.</p>''I write these words from a place of hopelessness, to honour a man who had great hope. I am struggling to think and speak about my friend, Chadwick Boseman, in the past tense. It doesnâ€™t make sense,'' Lupita wrote.<p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
