She <a href=# rel=noopener>uttered something</a> to one of the refs, which led to the initial tech. The 6'3" forward then walks away while waving her hand dismissively toward the official and quickly gets another whistle.</p><p>Forsberg, who wasn't the referee to eject Reese, declined to specify what Reese said, only telling reporters she "disrespectfully addresses the calling official." Forsberg added she "waves off the calling official in resentment to the call" before the second tech is issued.</p>Annie Costabile <span class=acct>@AnnieCostabile</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pool report transcript: &lt;a href="https://t.co/fWtxaQMrYe">https://t.co/fWtxaQMrYe&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/l1a4dyBbtP">pic.twitter.com/l1a4dyBbtP&lt;/a></p><p>Reese and her teammates were left puzzled by the ejection, and they weren't the only ones.

Reese's ejection is an example of how the standard across the league <a href=# rel=noopener>simply isn't good enough</a> and hasn't been for some time.</p><p>The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Ben Pickman</a> last October interviewed people around the W, who cited inexperience the rate of turnover among referees as potential sources behind the problem.</p><p>Reese's ejection ultimately didn't mean much because the Sky were going to lose with or without her down double digits with so little time left. But she and her team nonetheless have grounds to be frustrated since her exit stemmed from what was such a seemingly trivial reaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiDeYKMsKWbmV2Wu6ixy2apnp2jmnqmtsScq56cXZu8s3nDoqqrnaOlsqTAxa6jpbFdlrGlvsSsqqKml2K%2FprKMq5ysnZ6puqa602arqGWTlrmt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
