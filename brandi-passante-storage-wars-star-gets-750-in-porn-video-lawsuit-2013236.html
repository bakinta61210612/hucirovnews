Selna ruled in Passante's favor, granting her motion for a default judgment. She received a small fraction of the amount she was seeking because the judge reportedly ruled that Passante provided "absolutely no support for this calculation of damages” and “a lack of evidentiary support.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the lawsuit filed in October 2012, Passante charged Moore with false designation of origin, defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and disparagement.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the ruling, her attorneys' fees will be covered and Moore was ordered to "remove any remaining and undisclosed content of video from all websites and restraining Defendant from disseminating the content of the video."</p><p>Passante, who's starred in Storage Wars since 2010, does have the option to submit a renewed application or actual damages within 30 days of the judge's order.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOm6mappSeerGt0qyYp6yVYsC1u9Ganp5lp5a%2FtHnSrZirZZeawbR5lm5nZqGeYr2wvs1mraKclaR6ra3WrKyirF1nfXJ%2FkWxt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
