A decade later, a new boy band would then take that spotlight opening the boy band gap once again.</p><p><a href=#>16 top 40 hits in the U.K</a>. and their first killer debut single that instantly propelled them to stardom and earned a spot as one of the best selling singles of all time (‘What Makes You Beautiful’) – say hello to One Direction!</p><p>It’s important to note that while many critics (and numerous non-boy band fans) have criticized their image and sound, they cannot deny the amount of impact One Direction has made on the music market and pop culture in general.</p><p>Selling over 50 million records in a few years time isn’t something every artist has had the capability of doing especially when music sales have dropped dramatically over the last decade.</p><p>In addition, they’ve co-written a few songs on their albums which is considered grand since many artists these days don’t actually co-write and/or write their own songs anymore.</p><p>‘Story of My Life’ is a very memorable single and apart from ‘What Makes You Beautiful’ will definitely be clearly remembered in a few years time.
