Also, Burrow missed the team's final seven games.</p><p>That resulted in Higgins setting career lows across the board with 42 receptions for 656 yards and five touchdowns.</p><p>Even so, 25-year-old Higgins figures to be one of the hottest commodities on the free-agent market among receivers, assuming the Bengals don't re-sign or franchise him.</p><p>While Higgins signing with the Browns would make him an enemy in Cincinnati, there are several reasons why Cleveland could be a great landing spot.</p><p>For starters, Higgins would get to play across from Amari Cooper, which would give the Browns one of the NFL's best wide receiver duos.</p><p>He would also have a talented quarterback in Deshaun Watson throwing him the ball, an elite running back in Nick Chubb to take some pressure off, and one of the NFL's best defenses, although Watson and Chubb missed significant time due to injury in 2023.</p><p>Despite the Browns' injury issues, they went 11-6 and made the playoffs, so if they are healthier and add Higgins, they could be a major threat in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGuFdYSMr6CdnZ9isaa%2Fx5qsp2WnlsG0u81mp6Ksk52ytHnTnpxmoJmctKq60mamp2WSp7y4utJmmqimpKeupMCMoqVmamBngW66xaVkn6qVmnqis8SnmrI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
