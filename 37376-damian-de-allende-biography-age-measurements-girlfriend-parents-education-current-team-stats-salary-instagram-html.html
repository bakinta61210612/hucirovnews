What is Damian de Allende race? The renowned athlete's mother is Beverly de Allende while Damian de Allende father is Tony de Allende. With regards to race, Damian is white, this information having been clarified by the dad during a 2015 race debacle surrounding the rugby player. Tony stated that the family is white with Spanish origin, which is why Damien has a dark complexion. According to his education, <a href=# title="de allende" rel="nofollow noopener">Damian joined</a> Milnerton High School and then proceeded to the University of Cape Town.</p><h3>Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/485f578fbb6096f1.jpg><p class=align-left>The well-built athlete made his first team appearance in 2012 while representing Western Province in the Vodacom Cup where they played Pampas XV. However, like most starters, he only made three appearances and scored a single try during that campaign.</p><p class=align-left>Damian signed his first professional contract for a senior team in 2013 with the Stormers and Western Province. He stayed with Western Province until 2018 and with the Stormers until this year. With the two teams, young Allende made 91 appearances with the Stormers and scored 75 points. In comparison, he made only 27 appearances and scored 30 points with Western Province.</p><p class=align-left>Alongside the two teams, the talented athlete joined Kintetsu Liners of Japan where he stayed from 2015 to 2017. This was not the best period of his career as he only made four appearances and scored a measly five points. Following that, Damian joined his current team, Panasonic Wild Knights.</p><p class=align-left>Internationally, Damian received a call to the Springboks just before the 2014 mid-year rugby union tests. He made the final squad but had to pull out because of a medial knee ligament injury. However, Allende was called up again for the Rugby Championship in 2014 where he made the starting line-up against Argentina.</p><p class=align-left>Damian was back again in 2015 for the match between the Springboks and the World XV where he scored two tries. He made an impact in that game because he earned the praise of Robbie Deans, the former Australian coach. 2017 was a tricky year because Mr. Allende was red-carded controversially against New Zealand for a late tackle. He was not suspended but the Boks lost 25-24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/0c5ae60ab235f691.jpg><h3>Damian de Allende salary</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8f687d1adf561222.jpg><p class=align-left>Damian’s main source of income is from playing rugby.
