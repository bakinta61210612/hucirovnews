Itachi believed that eliminating the clan’s leadership and quelling the rebellion would ultimately protect the village and prevent further bloodshed. The weight of this decision and the emotional toll it took on Itachi were immense, showcasing the complexity and tragedy of his character.</p><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>Why Did Itachi Kill His Parents?</span></strong></h2><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi Uchiha’s decision to kill his parents, Fugaku and Mikoto Uchiha, was an integral part of the tragic events surrounding the Uchiha clan massacre. He believed that by eliminating the Uchiha clan’s leadership, including his own parents, he could effectively cripple the potential rebellion and prevent further bloodshed.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Fugaku, as the clan head, held significant influence and would have been a key figure in any uprising.

The primary motivation behind his actions was to prevent a full-scale Uchiha rebellion that posed a threat to the stability of Konohagakure, the village hidden in the leaves. Itachi believed that this uprising would ultimately lead to a devastating civil war and result in the destruction of the Uchiha clan, as well as countless innocent lives.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Additionally, Itachi was given the order to carry out the massacre in order to protect the village. Itachi, burdened by a deep sense of duty and loyalty to Konoha, reluctantly followed this order. He saw it as a necessary sacrifice to maintain peace and safeguard the well-being of his younger brother, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Sasuke</a>.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi’s actions were also influenced by his desire to protect the reputation of the Uchiha clan.

Danzo believed that the Uchiha clan’s growing dissent and potential coup posed a threat to the stability of the village.</p><p>In order to prevent a full-scale uprising and protect Konoha, Danzo gave the order for Itachi to carry out the massacre. Itachi reluctantly obeyed, shouldering the heavy burden of eliminating his own family for the sake of peace and the preservation of his younger brother, Sasuke.</p><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>How Old Was Itachi When He Killed His Clan?</span></strong></h2><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi was merely 13 years old when he killed his clan. Driven by a complex web of motivations and circumstances, Itachi made the heart-wrenching decision to eliminate his family, opting for a path of sacrifice to protect his village from an impending Uchiha rebellion. This shocking revelation of Itachi’s age during the clan massacre underscores the immense burden he bore at such a young age, as well as the profound impact his actions had on the series’ narrative and character development.</span></p><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>What Episode Does Itachi Kill His Clan?</span></strong></h2><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi killed his clan in episode 455 of Naruto Shippuden. In this episode, which is titled Moonlit Night, Itachi carries out the Uchiha clan massacre. This episode is regarded as one of the darkest episodes in the Narutoverse.</span></p><h2 class=p1><strong><span class=s1>Why Did Itachi Kill His Girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi was a complex and tragic character who was forced to make difficult decisions for the sake of his village and his family. One of such very difficult decisions was killing Izumi, who is regarded as his girlfriend. Izumi was a member of the Uchiha family. Everyone in his clan, including her, had to be wiped out. That was a prerequisite for ending the rebellion.<br></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi resolved to kill Izumi first because there was no going back after that. He crept into her residence and performed a Tsukuyomi on Izumi. In that illusion, she had a happy life with Itachi, where they were married and had children. The same delusion led to her falling ill and dying on her deathbed.<br></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Itachi resolved to take advantage of the timing and kill her right there and then. He was compelled to kill Izumi because she was a member of the Uchiha clan, but he did so gently. This was a strong indicator of his feelings for Izumi, and it appears that he was deeply saddened by his actions. </span>He seemed to care deeply for Izumi and to adore her. However, he had to choose between starting a war and murdering his clan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2Bstbp5w6KbZqGklrCptYykoKWkXZ22tHnCpZinZZGjsW60zrBkqKSUYsSiv4yhnGasmJq7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
