That moment where you can just lose and indulge yourself in pop-rock music and sing along to soulful lyrics is pretty much why Script fans, a.k.a The Script Family, love seeing their favourite band live…and that includes us!</p><p>As we take a trip back to our past concert experiences with this amazing band, we list down five of The Script’s best songs performed live!</p><h3>5. Hall of Fame</h3><p></p><p>The song is already known for the inspirational message brought by the lyrics. But by the way it is performed live by The Script, there’s nothing better than attending a concert where every single person is accepted for their love for music and not judge for who they are, where they came from and their past life.</p><p>What makes it more amazing live&nbsp;is when Danny O’Donoghue&nbsp;sends out a beautiful message at the beginning of the song.</p><p>“You can go the distance, you can run the mile, you can walk straight through hell with a smile”</p><h3>4. The Man Who Can’t Be Moved</h3><p></p><p>This song, which charted #2 in the UK, is at our fourth spot on the list.</p><p>The Script are always known to perform passionately in every set, and that includes interacting with their fans.</p><p>With the subtle beat of this song, the band encourages everyone to sing along with them. Together it creates an amazing atmosphere where everyone get to enjoy music and make great memories with this incredibly talented band.</p><p>“Cause if one day you wake up and find that you’re missing me, and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be.”</p><h3>3. Nothing</h3><p></p><p>While the lyrics of this song is basically about calling someone you’re trying to move on from while intoxicated with alcohol, the song comes from a less serious topic.</p><p>At times, the band would joke about it on stage before they perform the song. Maybe even dial someone’s ex and sing it to them through the phone, which is really entertaining for the fans.</p><p>“Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter? they say I’m better off now, than I ever was with her”</p><h3>2. Paint The Town Green</h3><p></p><p>Serves as an intro, the number one reason why fans love it so much live is that they get to interact with the band while the trio walk through the crowd to the stage at the beginning of the show, and also how it’s such an anthem song for The Script Family.</p><p>“Just like home, let’s color the streets like our own. Let’s make this place feel like our home”</p><h3>1. Breakeven</h3><p></p><p>This song is definitely a fan favourite from The Script, and so it landed on the #1 spot on our list!</p><p>Not all of us may be experiencing heart break, but the way they perform the song give us a sense as if the lyrics were happening to us in real life and makes us sing along at the top of our voices.</p><p>“What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you. What am I supposed to say when I’m all choked up and you’re okay”</p><p>Whatever song The Script play live, we’re pretty sure they all sound really amazing.</p><p>Got your own list of favourite live songs by the Irish trio?
