I’m seeing two generations connecting – the people who have been with me since 1999 and the crew who are just discovering me, both connecting on the same music, it’s the most amazing feeling. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I don’t know what’s going on right now!”</p><p>This is an incredible feat for Craig, who first rose to fame in 2000 when his first two singles&nbsp;‘Fill Me In’ and ‘7 Days’ reached number one. Before&nbsp;testing the waters with&nbsp;his comeback last year, we hadn’t heard any new material from Craig since 2010. Now, he is sitting pretty at the top of the charts and is set to complete a <a href=#>UK arena tour next year</a>, including two nights at London’s O2 Arena.</p><p>As well as releasing his latest album, Craig has been busy performing across the world. Alongside&nbsp;a residency in Ibiza, he has performed at numerous festivals this summer, including Fusion Festival, V and We Are FSTVL.</p><p>Congratulations to Craig David for securing his second number one album – whilst we all know and love his classic tracks, it’s great to see a lot of love for his&nbsp;brand new flow for two thousand sixteen too.</p><p>Are you loving Craig David’s album?
