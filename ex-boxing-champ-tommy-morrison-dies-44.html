Right before a fight with Arthur Weathers, he got the bad news, which subsequently ended his boxing career. Morrison denied having HIV in the years that followed.</p><p>He challenged the existence of the virus after claiming to have tested negative for the disease multiple times after the first positive result.</p><p>Trisha Morrison, who tied the knot with Morrison in 2011, also said she did not believe he had the disease. In a recent interview with ESPN.com, she insisted that Morrison had Guillain-Barre Syndrome, not HIV.</p><p>Trisha said Morrison was healthy until a year and a half ago when the doctor left a 12-foot piece of surgical gauze in his chest for eight days. She said Morrison’s health took a turn for the worse ever since then.</p><p>Holden declined to comment Monday on what caused Morrison’s death.</p><p>“I don’t know what the official cause of death at the hospital will be,” Holden said.&nbsp;“You prepare for things like this, and still you feel like you got hit by a truck when you hear the news.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX50e49yZmlqX5rFbq7OsaCnn12YtaK5z2arqKWdrnquu9GroKynnmKxqrHSZmttZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
