Take notice of how the cuts in the beginning are significantly different than in the third act. The dissolves change quite a bit, as well.”</p><p>For the record, director Kyle Edward Ball has said that a lot of the toys are from his own childhood, although he borrowed the Legos from a friend who had a collection of them (via Filmmaker). Whether the little plastic bricks are a deliberate part of the film’s temporal and spatial disorientation, or a simple continuity mistake, you probably have to be a real Lego nerd to notice the difference. Our guess? “Skinamarink” will have you too terrified out of your wits to even care.</p><p>“Skinamarink” is out now in theaters and premieres February 2 on Shudder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMDHnmSso5mjrq6t0aKlpGWcmrSwecOeq5qhnGLBqa3TZqqtoZOgwG671K1kraddm66vv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
