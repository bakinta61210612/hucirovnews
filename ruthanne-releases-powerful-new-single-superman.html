Mixed by Jay Reynolds (Dua Lipa, Paloma Faith), the track samples Dave Richardson & The Invincibles’ ‘Heart Full of Love’.</p><p>‘Superman’ is a stunning R&B offering from RuthAnne which truly packs a punch. Not only does she shine with her captivating vocals, but she once again delivers stellar lyrics which will resonate with many.</p><p>Speaking about ‘Superman’, RuthAnne said: “I wrote it about putting someone on a pedestal who you think is this great person, who you look up to, fall in love with but who isn’t what he/she seems. They abuse their power, they show their true colours and you can see them spiralling out of control. You come to your senses and see they aren’t so ‘super’ after all. I wrote it as an anthem for women who have felt men took advantage of them in their position.”</p><p>Listen to ‘Superman’ below.</p><p>‘Superman’ follows on from RuthAnne’s previous single <a href=#>‘Love Again’</a>, which gained a million streams in its first month. The track was featured in 13 New Music Friday Spotify playlists globally, including in the UK and US.</p><p>Alongside the release of her new single, RuthAnne has also announced a London headline show which will take place at Hoxton Square Bar & Kitchen on October 16.
