Sizemore had already done his time when he was arrested for breaking his probation in a drug case and sent back to jail.</p><p>He was trying to trick drug tests by using a fake prosthetic device, but he failed many of them. He was finally given a prison sentence of 16 months. Sizemore has dated several women, including Juliette Lewis, Heidi Fleiss, Mazine Entwistle, and Janelle Mclntire, despite his legal problems.</p><p>Janelle was his last girlfriend, and he had two kids with her. In 2005, they had their first child, a son named Jayden. In 2007, they had their second child. But their love didn’t last long, and they broke up in 2006.</p><p>Sizemore only got married once, to Marve Quinlan, an American actor, in 1996.
