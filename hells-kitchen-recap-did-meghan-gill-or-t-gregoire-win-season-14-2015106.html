On the Tuesday, June 9 Season 14 finale of Hell’s Kitchen, finalists <strong>Meghan Gill</strong> and <strong>T Gregoire</strong> faced off in a culinary competition that impressed the likes of Ramsay and other foodie giants like guest judge <strong>Wolfgang Puck</strong>. In the end, it was Roanoke, Va., chef Gill who took home the title and a $250,000 salary.</p><p>First tasked with executing five dishes in one hour for critique by Puck and other chef greats, Gill, 28, and Gregoire, 31, were neck-and-neck with Gregoire besting her foe by just one point. Later, Gill shined during the finale’s second dinner service.</p><p>Prior to firing up their stoves, the finalists were able to choose previously eliminated contestants to lend a hand. Gill chose <strong>Michelle</strong>, <strong>Allison</strong>, <strong>Josh</strong>, and <strong>Randy</strong>, while Gregoire picked <strong>Milly</strong>, <strong>Nick</strong>, <strong>Adam</strong>, and <strong>Christine</strong>. During the service, each chef faced their share of hurdles, with Randy overcooking chicken and Adam sending out two portions of raw meat.</p><p>At the end of service, Ramsay took both chefs to his office to see which ceremonial door handle would open, signaling that woman’s win. Gill’s door opened, and she was quickly celebrated by her family and fellow chefs.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Meghan Gill Hell's Kitchen" width=467 height=350 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“Winning Hell’s Kitchen is life-changing,” Gill <a href=#>said</a>. “I made the choice to compete and I executed. In taking that risk, I have catapulted my career into a realm only few people can imagine, and it’s awesome. It’s confirmation that hard work, discipline, and a genuine passion for your craft can only lead you in a positive direction. I get to do what I love every day, and now it’s in one of Chef Gordon Ramsay’s kitchens. I’m the luckiest girl in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gill, who specializes in French-based Mediterranean cuisine, told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> <a href=#>prior to Tuesday’s finale</a> that her fellow finalist was a formidable opponent. “She was like a dark horse. Now that I’m watching it on TV, I really see her strengths and I see how she grew throughout the competition,” Gill told <strong>Us</strong>. “I think that it blindsided me a little bit when we got into the black jackets and I was back in the kitchen with her and I was like, ‘Wait a minute!’ She’d really progressed.”</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Did the right chef win Hell’s Kitchen?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOoZylpKNiuKrAwqGcp2WimrCivIydoJ1lnZq0qa3NZp6ipJxivLN502aeq52XpLazsYywoKdlo5qutLvNZmhtZWJlfnZ9j28%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
