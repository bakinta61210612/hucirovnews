His artistry caught the attention of music legends from the likes of Quincy Jones, who counted him as one of his protégés, to rappers like The Notorious B.I.G., who used a sample from one of his biggest hits to make his signature classic the “One More Chance/ Stay with Me (Remix).”</p><p>Now, his children are proving that the sweet Debarge family fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree.</p><p>Over the holidays, El’s ex-wife Tracey Ferguson posted on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> footage of the former Motown singer with their two children, Joshua and Kyndall, hanging out and singing songs at the piano.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Tracey M.

OMG,” and “Genes are something else!!!! This blessed me.”</p><p>Before long, the short clips went viral and found themselves on the X platform, with fans just as enamored by the next generation’s voices as they were with El DeBarge’s.</p><p>One person said, “I follow Kyndall and her husband’s videos but didnt know shes el’s daughter, she got his singing voice and making it hers.”</p><p>“El DeBarge singing with his kids Josh & Kyndall has me in tears.

Over the past few years, the 62-year-old, who was once estranged from his family, has made great strides in rebuilding a relationship with his offspring.</p><p>El has 12 children, 11 of whom are his biological children and one that he has accepted as his own, by five different women.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with Jet magazine, he openly admitted that his 22-year struggle with drug addiction prevented him from being the kind of father that a sober version of himself would have aspired to be. The repercussions of his addiction led to one of his children, then just 3 years old, being removed from his and the mother’s custody and placed in the system. “I don’t know where she is,” he lamented, suspecting that she may have been adopted.</p><p>Now, clean and sober, he said he is aiming to be the best dad he can be and will never abandon his children again.</p><p>“I intend to be in their lives forever,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “God gave me a second chance. I am so very glad with what is going on with my career, but I want to be a success in my relationship with my children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmxpX5q5brDEm5irn5ViwLC6jJqlnWWUlsKotNOeqWain6i1tq2MpLCnnJGhuW6%2FyKeeoqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
