We Stan beautiful black Queens,’ and another follower posted this: ‘You did amazing Kandi, Those questions were great! You’re really good at this.’</p><p>One other follower said: ‘Kandi can you please help Ft. Hood in spreading the word about the missing soldier: Vanessa Guillén. #FindVanessaGuillen. If you could just repost a photo. Anything. We need help finding her. 💖🥺’ and a fan wrote: ‘You are amazing for doing this!’</p><p>Here’s the video that Kandi shared on YouTube:</p><p></p><p>A YouTube follower said: ‘Kandi is the perfect example of what it means to be successful without being loud, ignorant, and mean-spirited. She brings class and poise to the business world. Some may call it “boring”. I call it GENIUS.’</p><p>Someone else posted: ‘I still call her Fancy. She looks good after all these years. Why am I getting the feeling that Kandi will have a talk show soon?😃’</p><p>A commenter said: ‘Garcelle and Kandi are alot alike. They both are not going to lower their standards. Just to stay on the housewife show. They don’t need to kiss the ring of the person that THINKS they run the show. Just to stay on the show. Kyle and Nene both hate that. They want to be able to say and do what they want. And get away with it. I have so much respect for Kandi and Garcelle.’</p><p>Someone else posted this: ‘Garcelle is a great addition to Beverly Hills I like how she sees through Kyle. Please do a Speak on it with Denise Richards next. They both are carrying this season.’</p><p>In other news, Kandi <a href=#>shared a photo</a> on her social media account featuring her baby girl, Blaze Tucker.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The kid managed to impress Kandi’s fans, who gushed over her in the comments.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblrultYybrKuqpajAbr%2FHmqmeq12Weq%2Bx1maqqZ2RoHqwuoyiq2adoJ7AsLDEZqanZamkwrXBwZ5kbWlhan56ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
