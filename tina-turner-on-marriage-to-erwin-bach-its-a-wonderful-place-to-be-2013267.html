Everything! After 27 years together, <strong>Tina Turner</strong> and music producer <strong>Erwin Bach</strong> tied the knot in a private ceremony in Switzerland — and now, Turner says, life is perfect.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel=noopener>Hello!</a> magazine about her recent nuptials, the 73-year-old “Proud Mary” singer gushes that she has finally found nirvana. “It’s that happiness that people talk about, when you wish for nothing, when you can finally take a deep breath and say, ‘Everything is good,'” she says. “It’s a wonderful place to be.”</p><p>As was her wedding, it seems. Per Hello!, Turner and her longtime love were married in a lavish ceremony at their home on the banks of Lake Zurich, with celebrity guests including <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Oprah Winfrey </strong></a>and <strong>Bryan Adams</strong>. The women in attendance were reportedly asked to wear white, while the men donned black tie.</p><p>Turner, meanwhile, broke from tradition and rocked a stunning black silk tulle and lime-green taffeta gown with Swarovski crystal embellishment. She first spotted the Giorgio Armani frock at a runway show in Beijing, she revealed to Hello!, and she knew immediately she wanted to get it and save it for a special occasion.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I thought, ‘I gotta have that, even if I never wear it,'” the superstar shares. “Then I thought, ‘I know, that will be my wedding dress.'”</p><p>This is the second marriage for Turner, who was previously wed to musician <strong>Ike Turner</strong> from 1962 to 1976. Ike, who died from a cocaine overdose in 2007, often physically abused his wife; she documented their turbulent union in the memoir I, Tina. (The couple’s romance was also the inspiration for the 1993 biopic What’s Love Got to Do With It, starring <strong>Angela Bassett</strong> and <strong>Laurence Fishburne</strong>.)</p><p>Turner, an eight-time Grammy winner, became a Swiss citizen earlier this year. She has two kids: 55-year-old <strong>Craig</strong>, with musician <strong>Raymond Hill</strong>, and 52-year-old <strong>Ronald</strong>, with Ike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuippFiwba%2BzZ6pZqeeYrqivtGimKCdXam8brHRsKCnZZKWsKl5yK2qZpldrLyvsMSrna6kXaW5oq%2FEZquoZZKaenN8kGxpb28%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
