He is known by his stage name Shatta Wale, formerly Bandana. He claims he is the king of the African dance hall. His most popular song, "Dancehall King", won him Artist of the Year award at the 2014 Vodafone Ghana Music Awards. Wale is also an actor, having appeared in the movies Never Say. Never, The Trial of Shatta Wale and Shattered Lives. Having gained street credibility in a rather underdeveloped Ghanaian dancehall genre at the time, he became known for his 2004 single, "Moko Hoo", with Tinny. Later, known in the industry as Bandana, the song earned it a Ghanaian Music Award nomination. Bandana disappeared in the music industry for almost a decade until his rebranding in 2013. He started releasing music under a new name, Shatta Wale, under his label. In 2014, he reached 38th place in E.tv's Top 100 Most Influential Ghanaians.</p><table class=wikibox readability=18.5><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>October 17, 1984, Accra, Ghana</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Origin</td><td class=wk_value>Ghanaian</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Reggae, dancehall, Afrobeats</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Singer, songwriter, record producer, sound engineer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Vocals, keyboard</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>2004–present</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>Shatta Movement Records, Zylofon Music</td></tr><tr readability=20><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Sarkodie, Patoranking, Davido, D-Black, Jah Vinci, Oritse Femi, MzVee, Tinny, Fuse ODG, Alkaline, Edem, Burna Boy, Kwaw Kese, Sista Afia, Aidonia, Shenseea, Mr Eazi, Dammy Krane</td></tr></table><p>Reggae Singer Shatta Wale was born in Accra, Ghana on October 17, 1984.
