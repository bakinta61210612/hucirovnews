When he was 83 years old, Dick Nourse passed away.</p><p>Nourse said of her employment in the newsroom of KSL in 2007: “I was in love with my job and I wanted to be there, more than anything.”</p><p>The death of Dick Nourse came as a shocking realisation to the Utah <a href=#>community</a>. He has battled cancer three times.</p><p>After appearing on his first newscast at KSL-Channel 5 in 1964, he retired from reporting in 2007.</p><p>However, no information on Dick Nourse’s cause of death or funeral plans has been made public.</p><h3>A brief recap on the man behind the golden voice of Utah</h3><p>He described his trip from Colorado in 1964 while operating a brand-new ’63 Corvair. He described parking on Social Hall Avenue, where Salt Lake City’s three TV stations at the time were located, during a retirement tribute on KSL in 2007.</p><p>Nourse initially applied for a position at KUTV-Channel 2, but was rejected because of his lack of experience and was told to reapply in five years.</p><p>He went to KCPX (now KTVX)-Channel 4 the next day and got the same response.</p><p>But a few days later, Nourse went to KSL, where he was given an audition, and a few days later, he was hired as a news reporter for the first time.</p><p>He quickly assembled a staff at KSL that featured sportscaster Paul James and weatherman Bob Welti, both of whom were hired from Channel 4.</p><p>This team then went on to establish themselves as one of Utah’s longest-lasting anchor teams in television history.</p><p>At KDYL-TV (now KTVX), the first television station in Salt Lake City, Welti began his television career in 1948.</p><p>In the 1960s, KSL enlisted Welti and James to work with Nourse, creating a strong combination.</p><p>For many years, this three served as a stand-in for KSL’s on-screen persona as the station gradually rose to the top of the market.</p><p>The trio’s cooperation persisted until 1991, when James and Welti decided to call it a day. Nourse had a co-anchor alongside him from 1979 to 1991; Lindsay and Shelley Thomas alternated in that capacity.</p><p>There was unquestionably tangible chemistry on their trip to Vietnam, where locals graciously welcomed them into their houses, Nourse said in an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune during his retirement in 2007.</p><p>During that time, Nourse might have held the record for the longest tenure as a local news anchor, according to Beth King, who was speaking on behalf of the national office of the Society of Professional Journalists.</p><p>This declaration was made following Chris Clark’s retirement from WTVF in Nashville, where he had worked for 41 years.</p><p>Nourse was regarded as a consummate professional by former KSL news director Con Psarras and was well-known for his unshakable commitment.</p><p>He demonstrated a strong work ethic and was always there, never taking a sick day. He also showed genuine compassion for the neighbourhood he served.</p><p>Before he retired, Nourse’s well publicised battle with non-Hodgkin’s disease, a lymphatic system-related malignancy, had KSL viewers by his side every step of the way. It is remarkable that he overcame this difficult form of cancer.</p><p>Public information regarding Dick Nourse’s death, including his cause of death and funeral plans, is still unavailable.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="debi nourse,jan tolman nourse obituary,former utah news anchors,ksl news anchors 1985,shelley thomas ksl,bob welti,former kutv news anchors,former ktvx news anchors,dick nourse obituary,nick nurse history,nick nurse phone number,nick nurse salary" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
