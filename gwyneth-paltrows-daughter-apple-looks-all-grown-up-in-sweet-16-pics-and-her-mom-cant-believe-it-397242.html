You’re the light of my heart, you are pure joy. You’re wickedly intelligent and have the best, most dry and most brilliant sense of humor. I have the best time just being your mom. I love our nightly chats when I really get to hear what is on your mind.’</p><p>She went on to gush over her some more in the lengthy caption, writing: ‘You work hard to get whatever it is that you want to achieve, and you have grit and responsibility in spades. I’m so damn lucky to be your mother, you beautiful, and kind young woman. Thank you for choosing me. I adore you to the moon and back a zillion times. I am sorry you are having this particular birthday during these circumstances, but as always with you, you find the best in everything.’</p><p>The Goop star has been in quarantine just like everyone as well but working from home has been much easier thanks to the ‘moral support’ she’s been getting from her kids – Apple, and her brother Moses – who she shares with Chris Martin.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Previously, Gwyneth told Today’s Savannah Guthrie that she and her ex have been very committed to being a family for their young ones, even though they are no longer romantically involved.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXrMavsdOhZKmZnKm%2FsMPSZpuarZedwaa%2BjJqnqaSVYrmwu8qsZJqknGK0s7vWp2SuqF2eu26%2F1p6crWVha3qxtcKsZJqmlGK1pr6MpqamZZOWu7V5wZ6jop2mmnqqwIxscHBqZGd8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
