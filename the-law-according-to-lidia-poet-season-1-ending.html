To prevent them from leaving the city, she eventually locates Louis and Nicole on the train. When Louis becomes aggressive and tries to shove Lidia off the train, Nicole stops him in her terror and pushes Louis off, likely to his demise. She appears confused about killing the man she loves. Nicole is told to go to the police and confess by Lidia, who is brandishing a gun at her. Lidia is questioning Nicole’s assertion that she still has feelings for Jacopo.</p><h3>https://youtu.be/KyIeHa0zvXM</h3><h3>The Law According to Lidia Poët Season 1 Ending Explained<br>Is Jacopo Barberi released from prison?</h3><p>As The Law draws to a close Nicole is reportedly led into prison by cops in Lidia Pot Season 1.
