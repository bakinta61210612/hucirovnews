Werner set a deadline of March 9 for all other motions and said jury selection would began on March 20 with the trial itself slated to begin on April 3.</p><p>District Attorney Michael Allen asked for six weeks of trial, according to KXRM.</p><p>“I think if it’s pretty extensive in its findings and what the basis for different conclusions might be, we might have to put on more evidence than we otherwise would have,” Allen said.</p><p>Werner said he plans to seat 12 jurors and six alternates and will allow only audio streaming.</p><p>Stauch’s defense attorneys said they were concerned about publicity’s effect on jury selection, but Warner said that “publicity itself is not a basis for removal of a juror.”</p><p>“The question is, it doesn’t matter what you’ve heard, doesn’t matter what you’ve seen,” the judge said. “The question is, can you put that aside and decide the case based on the facts? And if the answer to that is yes, then it doesn’t matter what they’ve seen, it doesn’t matter what they’ve heard.”</p><p>strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</p><p>[Feature Photo: Gannon Stauch/Handout; Inset: Letecia Stauch via KRDO-TV/The Gazette/AP, Pool]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6m1qr7DZqSepqSWuW60xJqjraBdmsOiuNSaq6KnnmK%2Fpr%2FUpausZZGnv6rCxGadqKpdlrmtscaem2ajmaG5pr6MrKueqJ2kum6v0aKknmWfo7mqusRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
