The group would morph into Destiny’s Child in 1996 when they received a record deal.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Described</a> as a “hyper stylized mix of old-school girl group and newfangled fem-pop”, Destiny’s Child was incredibly successful.</p><p>Beyoncé was just <a href=# rel=noopener>15</a> when their first single was released and the band’s primary goal at that time was to sell records. It wasn’t long before they were selling millions, and their second album ‘The Writing’s on the Wall’ went multi-platinum and earned them <a href=# rel=noopener>Grammy Awards</a>.</p><p>The group was together from 1997 until 2002, although during this time some of the members left and were replaced.
