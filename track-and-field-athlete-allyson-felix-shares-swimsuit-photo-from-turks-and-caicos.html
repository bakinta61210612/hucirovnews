Felix, 37, shared a picture of herself walking in the aquamarine surf while wearing a white bikini, looking happy against a background of sea and blue skies. "Isn't it beautiful there? Enjoy!" commented Olympian Carrie Tollefson. Here's what Felix does to stay fighting-fit and ready to run.</span></p><p><span>Felix's favorite food is traditional soul food. "To me, cooking is love," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Just because of how busy I am, when I do get time to cook or bake for family or friends, it's very thoughtful — it's an expression of love… Black-eyed peas, mac and cheese, rice and gravy, catfish. All of that. My mom and my grandma (who lived with us growing up) would always make a big dinner Sunday after church. It brings back memories of those dinners when we would all just come together — family and friends — and connect over food."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Felix would train for hours when she was competing. "I train about five hours a day," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Three of those hours are on the track — warming up, stretching, doing drills and then the actual workout, which may be anything from very technical work on the starting blocks to speed work. From there, I go to the gym and spend a couple of hours doing strength and conditioning…&nbsp; I'm super-competitive, so I love that running is something that is not subjective. You can know on that day who is the best! And I love how personal and individual it is. You can constantly challenge yourself."</span></p><p><span>Felix enjoys a healthy, light diet when she's training. "I usually keep breakfast light: yogurt and granola," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "In transit to the gym, I'll have an acai bowl or some type of smoothie. Lunch is a salad with protein and fruit. And then for dinner (that's my biggest meal) I eat a lot of fish, brown rice or sweet potatoes and veggies. Asparagus is one of my favorites. And zucchini."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2107792250.jpg><p><span>Felix focuses on recovery and sleep as a necessity for good health. "Recovery is a huge piece of my training," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I really made that a priority this year. I think when I was younger I always felt like I wanted to do as much as I could — quantity was everything — and now that I'm older, and as a mom, it's really quality over quantity. It's about training smarter. For me, being able to focus on recovery allows me to come back and get quality work the next day as well."</span></p><p><span>When it comes to food, Felix prioritizes how it makes her feel. "I don't worry about counting calories, carbs or fasting," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I focus on my body's needs to succeed, which are long-lasting energy, hydration and strong, lean muscles. Nutritious food makes me feel good and perform well. Processed and junk food makes me feel tired and bloated — not a gold medal feeling!"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLW%2BwJyiZpmemXqntcSlm2aZpJ25psDEZpilpKmovK95xZ6jorBdqLWivsSsZKyvmaLAtrXTZqehp6Skeqe%2BzqZkra2ioMBurc2dZJyZmZi8tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
