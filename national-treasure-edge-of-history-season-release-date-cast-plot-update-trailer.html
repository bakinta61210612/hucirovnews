This will be, however, the first season of the National treasure show, as the other two have been movies. The upcoming show will delve deeper into the mystery that Gates never examined.</p><p>The upcoming show is based on the National Treasure movies released in 2004 and 2007, and they did extremely well. With the movies getting adapted into a series and a new story altogether, will it do as well as the previous movies? Only one way to find out!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>National Treasure: Edge of History Season 1 Release Date:</h2><p>Fortunately, we will not need to wait for an eternity for the series release as it has already been slated for a December 14th release date. The first two episodes of the show will be released on the 14th then all the other episodes will release weekly up until the last one. This means that the series will be released up until mid-February, and you will have a show to keep you engrossed each week. If you want to binge on the show, then this is the time to get a Disney subscription, as the show will only be available on Disney.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>National Treasure; Edge of History Season 1 Plot:</h2><p>Since the upcoming show is a sequel, it will continue the story of the national treasures. The second plot will be filled with treasure hunting, maps, and lost history that is slowly getting traced. However, the upcoming series will also have a different mystery you want to take advantage of. The upcoming show will have a wrapped mystery that has never been explored before and is about to get exciting. Two people are on the hunt for boxes that are considered key to some of the most precious artifacts. With one of the explorers possessing a weird cube and the series taking <a href=#>inspiration</a> from the Mexican –American war, the upcoming plot will be a force to reckon with.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>National Treasure; Edge of History Season 1 Cast:</h2><p>Nicolas Cage will not be reprising his role as he has been busy with other projects. However, his role as the protagonist will be taken by Lisette Olivera, playing Jess Morales, the 22-year-old who sets on a journey to learn more about her family heritage. Catherina Zeta will play Billie Pearce, the black market dealer who wants to steal Jess Clues to find the national treasures. Justin Bartha (<a href=#>The Good Fight</a>) will be reprising his role as Riley Poole, the tech specialist, and Harvey Keitel (<a href=#>Mike</a>) as Agent Peter Sadusky.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>National Treasure: Edge of History Season 1 Trailer:</h2><p>Luckily a trailer for the upcoming series has already been released, and you can check it out on Youtube. The 17-second teaser gives little on what to expect of the upcoming show, but at least it highlights some things you should expect once season one comes out. The series teaser starts with a woman’s shadow and then flashes the artifacts at the National Treasure. The artifacts flashing on the screen hint enough that the national artifact’s history will be discussed. Mark your calendars for December 14th, as you want to attend the series debut.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57zZqroqeelrluwNGemKytopp6prDGnmSonl2dtrTAzquwZquVlsCwuoyrnKWdkaiybrDArZxmm5GowW68y6irZq2gma61sYytqZqhnJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
