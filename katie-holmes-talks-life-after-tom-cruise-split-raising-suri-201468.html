Almost exactly two years after her headline-grabbing divorce from <strong><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Katie Holmes</a></strong> stopped by the Today show on Wednesday, Aug. 6, to discuss <a href=#>her new role in The Giver</a>, as well as her real-life role as mommy to <strong><a href=#>Suri Cruise</a></strong>.</p><p>"I'm a risk-taker," Holmes told <strong>Matt Lauer</strong> of her life as a self-described artist. "I love adventures and new things." In the upcoming dystopian flick based on <strong>Lois Lowry</strong>'s beloved young adult novel, Holmes <a href=#>plays the unnamed mother</a> of the hero, Jonas (<strong>Brenton Thwaites</strong>). "I approached it like all mothers when their child is leaving the nest," the actress explained. "There's a pain. There's a loss. That's how I approached the character."</p><p>"For several years, you were a very hardworking actress who became uber-famous for other reasons completely," Lauer noted of her fame. (Holmes, 35, rose to fame in the '90s in popular drama Dawson's Creek, but was sky lifted into A-list territory during her marriage to Cruise from 2006 to 2012.) "Do you ever think you would make a deal and trade some of that fame to go back to that person you were beforehand?" Lauer asked.</p><p>"You know what?" Holmes responded. "I never really look back. I just approach life [taking] it one day at a time. I'm really excited about where I am right now. I've had some really wonderful creative experiences. I'm just really grateful."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Regardless of the many projects Holmes has in her life, no role is more important to the actress than being mom to 8-year-old Suri, she says.</p><p>While she's unable to give Suri the "gift of normalcy" that she had growing up in Ohio, the Manhattan-based star told Lauer: "Of course you try your best. I try very hard because I'm very grateful for my upbringing, my parents, my siblings. I try to do what they did for me for my little one."</p><p>She added, "The most important thing for me is letting her know how proud I am and her accomplishments mean everything. Whatever I do is whatever. It's really just about her. That's what I think is most important."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKKarJmaeqm7y6acrGWklrmsv4yloJ%2BdXZaztbHRZquopV2Yv7a10p5krKicnsFuvsCiqqKml2LAtr7IZmlpaWRrhQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
