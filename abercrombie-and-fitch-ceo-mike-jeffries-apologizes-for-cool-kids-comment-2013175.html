Abercrombie & Fitch CEO <strong>Mike Jeffries</strong> issued <a href=#>an official statement</a> on Wednesday, May 15 in light of the recent backlash surrounding comments he made back in 2006 about his brand's target audience — but the apology isn't getting much love from angry customers.</p><p>"I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview," he starts the statement. "While I believe this 7 year old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense."</p><p>Jeffries goes on to call the brand an "aspirational" one that "targets its marketing at a particular segment of customers."</p><p>"We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics," he concluded.</p><p>Earlier this week, quotes from a 2006 Salon interview revealed that Jeffries had once admitted that <a href=#>he only wanted the "cool and popular kids"</a> to shop at his stores.</p><p>"We go after the cool kids," he was quoted as saying, in reference to his company's target demographic. "A lot of people don't belong, and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely."</p><p>Jeffries' inflammatory comments prompted celebrities like <a href=#><strong>Kirstie Alley</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sophia Bush</strong></a> to speak out about his prejudiced viewpoints.</p><p>"Abercrombie clothes are for people who are cool and look a certain way and are beautiful and are thin blah, blah, blah, blah," Alley said on Entertainment Tonight. "That would make me never buy anything from Abercrombie."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Los Angeles-based writer <strong>Greg Karber </strong>even took to YouTube to propose a different kind of solution to get back at Abercrombie.</p><p>In a two-and-a-half minute video, Karber suggests that viewers donate all of their Abercrombie clothes to homeless shelters so that the many homeless members of the city can be clothed.</p><p>"Together," he says in the voiceover, "we can make Abercrombie & Fitch the world's No.1 brand of homeless apparel."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJibnaKYv7C5waKcZpmemXqntdOcn2ablaR6rrXKnmSjnZabv6qx0maYqaecpLSqxsSsZJ%2BnomKwsLvLZqKinKNisLC5zJ6lrWViZX50fZZu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
