It’s faster, easier to remember, and they’ll speak with trained mental health counselors.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Congress passed the bill in 2020 designating 9-8-8 as the 3-digit crisis number and then-President Donald Trump signed it into law.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF"><b>RELATED: </b><b>New 988 hotline is the 911 for mental health emergencies</b></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Calls to the old lifeline, 1-800-273-8255, will still go through even with 988 in place.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“If we can get 988 to work like 911 … lives will be saved,’’ said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">When a mental health counselor answers, they assess the individual’s situation, deescalate, and then find resources in their community to help them.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The federal government gave more than $280 million for mobile mental health crisis teams that can go to people’s homes and emergency mental health centers.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Dr. Christine Cauffield with LSF Health Systems, a group that provides mental health services, says the three-digit number is going to benefit so many people and shared some signs that people shouldn’t hesitate to call the number.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“If you’re feeling suicidal, thinking about harming yourself or someone else. If you’re very depressed and feeling that life is not worth living, if you’re feeling very anxious, and feel like there’s no help available, whatever those thoughts are that are causing you to stress, causing you to not want to get up out of bed, causing interference with family relationships, or with job responsibilities, it’s time to reach out and get some help,” Cauffield said.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">LSF Health Systems has set up mobile response teams in our area.</p><h3 class="sc-bwzfXH dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-5 dZRBCJ"><b>Will it help?</b></h3><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">We understand this is not an easy topic to discuss, but we want to know if you think the new 988 number will make a difference and possibly save lives.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">If you have been helped in the past by a call to a mental health crisis hotline, we want to know what you think of the new nationwide three-digit hotline and whether it will lead to more people reaching out for help when they need it.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Please use the form below to share your thoughts with us.</p><p>Copyright 2022 WJXT and The Associated Press.
