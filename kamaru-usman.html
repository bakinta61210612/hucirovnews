He was born in this world on the 11th of May 1987 to a middle-class family in a small town called Auchi.</p><p>After spending eight years of his life in average living conditions, his father brought him and his entire family to the US.</p><p>However, things didn’t become smooth so quickly. As a kid with poor English and black descent, Usman’s fellow classmen often teased and bullied him. He used to play football during his sophomore year.</p><p>Still, a significant injury led him to find an alternative path in wrestling and, later down the road, a career in MMA.</p><p>Both MMA and wrestling came to him in the same way, and he had eventually blown up without his knowledge.</p><h2>Kamaru is Married to His Wife Eleslie Dietzsch</h2><p><a href=#>Kamaru Usman</a> has been married to Eleslie Dietzsch for over a few years now.
