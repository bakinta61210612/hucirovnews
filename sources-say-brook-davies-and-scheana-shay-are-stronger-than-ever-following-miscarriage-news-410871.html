The Vanderpump Rules star announced the news earlier this year.</p><p>Underneath an Instagram photo, Davies wrote that he has Shay’s back the same way she has his. It’s been a difficult time for Shay, and she’s commented on her struggle before.</p><p>For instance, during an episode of her podcast, Scheananigans with Scheana Shay, the reality star claimed she first found out she was pregnant earlier this year. The reality star said that many of her fans already know that she had frozen her eggs on two occasions.</p><p>She always thought that it wasn’t possible for her to have kids on her own. But she was wrong. According to Shay, doctors told her it would be next to impossible for her to get pregnant, however, she took a pregnancy test after getting sick and missing her period.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CB6nhXLjq5K/</p><p>After confirming she was pregnant, she began bleeding for much of the weekend while on a trip to San Diego. Subsequently, she booked an appointment with her doctor, and they noticed that there wasn’t a heartbeat.</p><p>According to the reality star, it was a difficult thing for her to get through, especially the part where she had to wait to “naturally miscarry.” Moreover, the reality star commented on the fact she has been treating her body as if she’s still pregnant, but nothing needs to be taken care of.</p><p>Many of Shay’s co-stars and friends, including Ariana Madix on Vanderpump Rules, wrote to her on social media. The Blast says that Madix shared the message on her IG, “Can’t wait to squeeze you.”</p><p>Earlier this week, it was reported by a number of outlets that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shay was relying on Stassi Schroeder – who’s also pregnant with her man, Beau Clark – for support.</a> The reality star shared that in the last few weeks, they’ve been speaking to each other more than the past few years.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>While many of their fans think the news will bring a lot of trouble in their lives, sources say Shay and Brock are “stronger than ever.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejpMKzr8SsZKyZqWKvs7vOpGSdmaaesrR5wKebZquTnbKiusBmqqGZqWKus7GMrKurp56csrN506GYp2WVq7KzecWoo6Wnp567qHnMoqqcmaKntqKzxGalnq%2BjYoFyfJdwaGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
