With all due respect. Because all we're focused on is the Dallas Cowboys, and they definitely deserve our attention. So as we clean up our game from the previous, we'll be thinking about that and the narratives will be what they be. We're not really concerned. We know that will exist but it's really inconsequential to what we're trying to do."<p>The Dolphins are 10-4 on the season and are in line to clinch a playoff berth for the second straight year.</p><p>However, Miami is also 0-3 against teams that currently have winning records, falling to the Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles and Buffalo Bills, all of which are considered to be among the NFL's elite.</p><p>McDaniel previously <a href=# rel=noopener>addressed</a> the narrative about the team's failures against winning teams following its loss to the Chiefs last month, saying that it's "something that I think we're all very aware of."</p><p>"And that's fair," McDaniel added at the time. "We shouldn't feel entitled to high opinions from the masses. We have to earn that confidence."</p><p>The Dolphins are now going up against a 10-4 Cowboys team that has already clinched a playoff berth and is contending for the No. 1 seed in the NFC alongside the Eagles and San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>If the Fins fall to the Cowboys, the narrative that they can't beat a winning team will only gain momentum.</p><p>Luckily for Miami, Dallas has struggled on the road this season, going 3-4 away from AT&T Stadium. Additionally, the Fins have been one of the NFL's best home teams, going 6-1 at Hard Rock Stadium.</p><p>That said, the stars are aligned for the Dolphins to finally get a win against a team with a winning record.</p><p>After facing Dallas, the Dolphins will also take on the 11-3 Baltimore Ravens and 8-6 Bills to close out the season. If they can't beat any of those teams, it's hard to imagine they'll be able to contend for a Super Bowl title.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGaGdX6MpqCknV2isKWtzaKcpWWkpLmlecOoo6mgmaPAbsDOZquepJxiuqawyJpkraddm3qwssVmrqKsmGK7sLqMnKawmp%2BuwG691J6qraGfo8A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
