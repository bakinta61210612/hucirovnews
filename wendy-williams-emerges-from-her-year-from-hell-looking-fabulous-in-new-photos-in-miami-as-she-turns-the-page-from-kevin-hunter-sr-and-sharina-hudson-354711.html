I’m sooo missing doing the show & my routine. Family is great but ok. Bye! I’m in lounge trying to figure out who has the best soul food for New Year’s Day. In my culture, certain foods on THAT day represent health & money. Are you familiar with this 1800s tradition?”</p><p>One fan said this: “Wishing you and your family well wishes and an awesome holiday while in south Florida.”</p><p>Another person claimed: “So auntie, are u going to come out and say you’re dating boof? Just Wendy is always more than enough! I hope you are enjoying your holidays in our great state!”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6lljvhBKnD/</p><p>This backer wrote: “How you doing!? Happy holidays! Looking sooooo pretty MS Wendy💙💙😊😊.”</p><p>This follower revealed: “Wow, black and white photos suit you perfectly! You are gorgeous!!!! I like that particular wig, Wendy.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6lBELLh_R2/</p><p>An insider spoke to Hollywood Life and said this about Wendy’s new life: “Wendy is having an amazing time in Miami, and she feels it’s so good for her soul to be surrounded by family during this holiday season. Wendy is such a strong, independent woman and is loving her freedom since her split from Kevin Sr.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6gt9dNhged/</p><p>The source continued: “But at the same time, having all the love and support from her huge family has made all the difference in the world. Wendy feels so grateful and blessed to be able to see them whenever she cares, but to have them around this Christmas made it especially memorable for her.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Wendy seems to be eager to enter 2020 and to do great things. Will the divorce get finalized soon?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnEppyrn5Woeqe%2BzqZkoZ2iYsamrdFmnaunnWK1prjLZqOop5ueu6h5xZqZrqSfqsButc1mpZ6vXaW1sMDOrGSipl2itqK5yGaYrGWjnbJuwNSrpaxlpJ2ybrzAoJxmnqKkum63xK%2Bgp2WYqru1sdFmqqtlkaOxbr%2FHmqmippFitbaw0qilZmtlaYRyfY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
