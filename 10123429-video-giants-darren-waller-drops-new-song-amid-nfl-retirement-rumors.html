He married Plum in March 2023, but the couple filed a <a href=# rel=noopener>joint petition</a> for divorce in April 2024.</p><p>In a post on social media after the divorce filing, Plum wrote she was "devastated" and "walked through fire" for Waller, "but now I see it's time to go."</p>Kelsey Plum <span class=acct>@Kelseyplum10</span><p lang=zxx dir=ltr>&lt;a href="https://t.co/mo6S7D7zE9">pic.twitter.com/mo6S7D7zE9&lt;/a></p><p>Waller's decision to reference "everything that happen 'tween you and ya wife on TMZ" in his newest song is an interesting choice considering he specifically told <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ Sports</a> about the meaning behind the previous song and music video.</p><p>"I've struggled with intimacy in romantic relationships my whole life, and I recognize the toll it has taken on the lovers I've been close to," Waller said. "Essentially, I'm telling myself, from the damage I've done, that it's imperative for me to heal the wounds in my life I've been avoiding by seeking relationships."</p><p>If Waller's NFL career comes to an end, he will be walking away from <a href=# rel=noopener>three years and $35.6 million</a> remaining on his contract. The deal doesn't include anymore guaranteed money, so the Giants could get out of it with minimal financial penalties if they wanted to.</p><p>Waller, 31, spent last season with the Giants after being acquired in a March 2023 trade with the Las Vegas Raiders. He began his NFL career with the Baltimore Ravens before being signed by the Raiders off their practice squad in November 2018.</p><p>A hamstring injury limited Waller to 12 games last season. He finished second on the Giants with 52 receptions and 552 receiving yards.</p><p>The Giants' three-day mandatory minicamp will run from June 11-13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiBc4WMr6CdnZ9itKqtza2qZpyRp7%2BmuoywmKWklad6pb7OqapmppWserS7zaBkmqWZmXqvsstmqZ6smaeyrrHNrWSrrZ2kv7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
