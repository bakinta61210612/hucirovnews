The 20-year-old's college eligibility was uncertain because he played professionally for SC Derby in the Montenegrin Basketball League and ABA Derby for two seasons from 2021 to '23.</p><p>He went through the NBA pre-draft process in both 2022 and 2023 before withdrawing his name.</p><p>Ivisic's arrival on campus in Lexington was <a href=# rel=noopener>delayed</a> until Oct. 12 due to complications with the school's admissions process.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Andy Patton</a> of SI.com noted the university was able to get Ivisic enrolled in "part-of-term" courses to grant him academic eligibility, but the ongoing questions about his amateur status prevented him from being allowed to participate in Wildcats games and practices.</p><p>In a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>Tristan Pharis</a> of KYInsider.com on Oct. 26, Kentucky said there was a "miscommunication" regarding Ivisic's approval from the NCAA and it would "adhere" to NCAA rules until he received full clearance.</p><p>Head coach John Calipari <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> earlier this week they would look to "become aggressive" with the NCAA to get a resolution, one way or another, to this situation if it came to that.</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Givony</a> called Ivisic a "formidable shot-blocking presence" with his 7'2" size who is capable of attacking the basket or shooting from three-point range.</p><p>It's unclear when Ivisic will be ready to play in games, but he's eligible immediately whenever Calipari wants to use him.</p><p>The Wildcats are currently ranked No. 8 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll with a 13-3 record. They have the <a href=# rel=noopener>best offense</a> in the nation by points per game (90.8) and seventh-best by efficiency with a 120.3 rating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqGdH2MpJynrKWYuLq%2FjLOtqKaZorazecivoKyhk2K%2FtrjEnWSepJmctqO4xGadqKpdZ31zf4xra2abkpd6tLHArKanZZKueq%2BvwJo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
