by Bragantino, which saw them sit top of Serie A after eight games, they have now slipped down the table into fifth.</p><p>They lost their last league match 2-1 to Fluminense and will be looking to get one over Corinthians here as the two teams sit side by side in the table.</p><p>Mauricio Barbieri’s side have not been on the best of form recently, failing to win in their last four league matches, with their last win in the league coming at the end of August when they defeated America Mineiro 2-0 away from home.</p><p>Since then, they have drawn two and lost two, including a poor defeat at home to bottom side Chapecoense, but they have managed to reach the final of the Copa Sudamericana in that time after they defeated Paraguayan side Libertad 5-1 on aggregate.</p><p

Bragantino in sixth.</p><p>Timao recorded a 2-1 victory last time out at home to Palmeiras, who sit in second place, thanks to a brace by <a href=# title="More Roger Guedes"><strong class=autotag>Roger Guedes</strong></a> and they will be looking to build on the win and overtake Bragantino in fifth.</p><p>A top-four finish is still very much possible for both sides at the moment despite Flamengo sitting in fourth, two points above them with games in hand.</p><p><a href=# title="More Sylvinho"><strong class=autotag>Sylvinho</strong></a>‘s side have been impressive away from home this season and sit third in the away table, picking up 20 points from 11 matches, which will give them confidence heading to Braganca Paulista, against a Bragantino side that has a poor home record this term, picking up just 12 points in 10 games.</p><p>Bragantino Brasileiro form:</p><ul class=fg_results><li><span class=fg_loss title=Loss>L</span></li><li><span class=fg_win

expected to start up top once again on Saturday having established himself as Braga’s top league goalscorer this season, scoring eight goals in 17 matches as well as assisting three.</p><p>Twenty-year-old <a href=# title="More Adson"><strong class=autotag>Adson</strong></a> is expected to miss out for Corinthians due to injury, with the midfielder having missed the last five games, as well as <a href=# title="More Ruan Oliveira"><strong class=autotag>Ruan Oliveira</strong></a>, who is out with a long-term injury which has limited him to just four appearances this

star <a href=# title="More Willian"><strong class=autotag>Willian</strong></a> featuring on the left flank.</p><p><strong>Bragantino possible starting lineup:</strong><br>Cleiton; Aderlan, Bruno,

Corinthians</h2><p>Bragantino’s home form is a concern and after featuring midweek, they are expected to have some tired legs.</p><p>Corinthians’ form has also been top notch recently and they will
