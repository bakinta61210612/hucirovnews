"There were question marks about the interviews. He was nervous. He didn't make shots at the pro day."</p><p>Filipowski averaged 16.4 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game during his sophomore season with the Blue Devils.</p><p>The 20-year-old also expanded his range in his second season at Duke, connecting on 34.8 percent of his threes while attempting 3.1 long-range shots each night. He shot 50.5 percent from the field overall, representing an increase from his 44.1 field goal percentage as a freshman.</p><p>His 2024 March Madness performance likely didn't do him any favors, as he averaged 11.0 points and 8.8 rebounds on 42.9/33.3/73.3 shooting splits in four NCAA Tournament games. Filipowski's <a href=# rel=noopener>wingspan</a> was also shorter than his height at the NBA draft combine, which typically isn't a strong selling point for first-round prospects.</p><p>Still, his slide out of the first round confused Givony.</p><p>"It's hard to find a seven-footer like Kyle Filipowski who is this skilled," he said on Thursday. "Somebody needs to draft him very early in the second round."</p><p>Givony wasn't the only one perplexed by his fall, as Boston Celtics superstar and former Blue Devil Jayson Tatum claimed that a lot of teams would regret passing on Filipowski.</p>Jayson Tatum <span class=acct>@jaytatum0</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lot of teams gone regret passing up on Flip &lt;a href="https://t.co/uS1E6caYtF">https://t.co/uS1E6caYtF&lt;/a></p><p>The center didn't have to wait too long to hear his name called on Day 2, as the Utah Jazz eventually <a href=# rel=noopener>selected</a> him with the No. 32 overall pick. However, it appears that a poor performance in pre-draft workouts and interviews contributed to his second-round slide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuAd4WMp5maZZmjwKqwxKtkpLGcmnqntcuip6ivo6C2tHnWqKmkp6WpwG61za2cq66ZmsS0edaeqZ6mpGK0s7HArWSapZmZeqW%2BwJ%2BrZqucnrGm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
