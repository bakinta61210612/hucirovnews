While recently visiting <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly’s</strong></a> NYC headquarters, the legendary multi-platinum singer opened up about participating in Lifetime’s controversial <strong>Whitney Houston</strong> biopic.</p><p>“There was a lot of mixed feelings. It is a sensitive thing, but it’s a very complex situation,” Cox, 40, told Us Weekly’s Entertainment Director Ian Drew. “I really just wanted to honor her and this was a way to do that. I’ve always loved her music so it was a great tribute.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The “Things Just Ain’t the Same” singer re-recorded Houston’s vocals for Whitney, which starred <strong>Yaya DaCosta</strong> in the title role and was directed by Houston’s Waiting to Exhale costar <strong>Angela Bassett</strong>. The buzzed-about TV movie — which chronicled Houston’s volatile relationship with <strong>Bobby Brown</strong> and drug use — premiered in January and was slammed by the l<a href=#>ate star’s mom, <strong>Cissy Houston</strong>.</a></p><p>“I didn’t hear anything from the family. There was something between Lifetime and the family that was a bit awkward,” Cox told Us. “But all of us as a team wanted to make sure the music sounded authentic.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The entertainer — who is set to release a new album titled Work of Art in late summer — collaborated with Houston in the 2000 R&B song “Same Script, Different Cast.” (Cox’s first single off her new album, <a href=#>“More Than I Knew,”</a> dropped Tuesday.) She noted that she’s not close to Houston’s loved ones, but has been thinking of her daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown. Houston and Brown’s daughter has been in a <a href=#>medically induced coma</a> since late January after being found facedown and unconscious in her Atlanta bathtub.</p><p>“It’s very sad. I’ve said my prayers,” Cox said. “I hope for a miracle.”</p><p>Watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJuemp%2Bnrql5wqivZpyVm7KvsNJmrqGhpKOyunnHqKysrJ%2BjeqO1zqmgnGWklrmsv4ybppuamWK4s7XSraCnmV1if3F9lGprbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
