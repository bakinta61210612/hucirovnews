After a grim second season, creator <strong>Jenji Kohan</strong> has said that the new batch of episodes will focus more on motherhood, faith, and getting to know who the women really are.</p><p>But before you stock up on snacks and hibernate for the weekend to binge-watch the newest episodes, let <strong>Us Weekly</strong> catch you up on where things left off in Season 2.</p><p><strong>Vee vs. Red</strong></p><p>Red (<strong>Kate Mulgrew</strong>) found her position as HBIC threatened as Season 2 began. There was a new sheriff in town, former Litchfield Queen Bee Vee (<strong>Lorraine Toussaint</strong>), who was ready to take names and steal Red’s women. The season-long tug-of-war between the two prison leaders lead to Red strangling Vee and Vee beating up Red.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Alex Can’t Be Trusted</strong></p><p>In the Season 2 premiere (directed by the one and only Jodie Foster), Piper (<strong>Taylor Schilling</strong>) was sent to testify in Alex’s (<strong>Laura Prepon</strong>) trial against her drug boss Kubra Balik. The two planned to lie to the court about their relationship with Kubra (despite Piper wanting to come clean), but Alex betrayed Piper and instead told the truth. This screwed everything up for Piper, who found herself in even more trouble. Ugh, Alex, how could you?</p><p><strong>Piper & Larry = It’s Complicated</strong></p><p>Season 2 saw the married couple finally succumb to the fractures in their relationship. First Alex betrayed Piper, and then Larry (<strong>Jason Biggs</strong>) cheated on her — with her best friend Polly (<strong>Maria Dizzia</strong>), of all people! Since Biggs is not returning to the show this season, it’s safe to assume that Larry isn’t in the picture anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Someone’s Pregnant!</strong></p><p>Time for some good news: As we already knew, our favorite forbidden lovebirds — inmate Daya (<strong>Dascha Polanco</strong>) and guard Bennett (<strong>Matt McGorry</strong>) — are expecting! If discovered, Bennett could lose his job. Daya, Red, and the other women concocted a plan to hide the pregnancy and urged Daya to have sex with Mendez (<strong>Pablo Schreiber</strong>) so the pregnancy could be blamed on him. The plan worked: They were caught together, and as a result Pornstache was fired. The things people do for love!&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>That Finale</strong></p><p>Bennett finally admitted to Caputo that he’s the one who got Daya pregnant, Vee escaped from prison via Red’s not-so-secret greenhouse pipeline, and terminally ill Rosa (<strong>Barbara Rosenblat</strong>) found out the chemo for her cancer wasn’t working so she only had a few weeks to live. Reeling from this news, Rosa fled, stealing a prison van. She spotted a wandering Vee on the road, fresh off her escape from Litchfield. So what does Rosa do? Oh, just hit Vee with the van and never look back.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Are you excited for to the new season of Orange Is the New Black?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOqKmappeaeqq%2FjK2fnmWemsRursuamqRlo5qutLvNZmpmqpWbv6a%2Fx56pZpqiqsCpedSpZKimXaiyor%2FOp2RrZWJlfnZ9j28%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
