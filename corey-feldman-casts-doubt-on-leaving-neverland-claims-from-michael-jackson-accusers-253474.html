The Lost Boys star claimed that Michael never touched him inappropriately or made sexual remarks, ever.</p><p>“He never touched me inappropriately,” the infamous child star remarked, adding that Michael had an innocence about him that was not sexual or explicit in any way. Corey did speak on the similarities between his own experience and that of James and Wade, however.</p><p>Corey stated that it all appeared to be true right up until the “sex part,” as he referred to it. According to Feldman, he and Michael did talk and befriend one another but there was never sexual intercourse as James and Wade claimed in the docu-series.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEVER ONCE SWORE IN MY PRESENCE, NEVER TOUCHED ME INAPPROPRIATELY, & NEVER EVER SUGGESTED WE SHOULD BE LOVERS IN ANY WAY!

James and Wade claim Michael began abusing them between the ages of seven and ten. You can check out some of Corey’s tweets below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEVER ONCE SWORE IN MY PRESENCE, NEVER TOUCHED ME INAPPROPRIATELY, & NEVER EVER SUGGESTED WE SHOULD BE LOVERS IN ANY WAY!

Kelly.&nbsp;The allegations against Michael became the most controversial amid his criminal trial in the mid-2000s for which he was exonerated, as R. Kelly was in 2008.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTpL%2BmxYyfnKWcnZa7bq%2FArKusZZSkwqPAjKilZqSVlsOqusZmpZ6ulae5orrDZpqlmZmiwG6y0aikZqWZmLWisctmoZqbm6i8r3nAnJquq5WnwG5%2BlGxrcGxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
