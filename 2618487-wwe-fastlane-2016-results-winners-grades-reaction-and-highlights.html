They went from friends to rivals and back in a whirlwind bout. Ambrose wasn't just the guy brought in to eat the pin. He was an explosive ingredient that boosted the action in a big way.</p><p>Lesnar was his usual captivating-conqueror self. WWE did well to soften the blow of his loss by having him go through two tables and feel the sting of a steel chair in order to fall short.</p><p>Going with Ambrose as the surprise winner would have been incredible, but Reigns-Triple H has been the story WWE has been building toward all along. Ambrose, meanwhile, is now set up for one hell of a collision with Lesnar at WrestleMania.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9paGmFeHnWsJxmnpGowa2tzZ5ka2hha3qzsdKuo62rXay2r7rEq6pmn6KWsaa%2FjKucmpuknryvecCnm2agmZy1rbXGoaus</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
