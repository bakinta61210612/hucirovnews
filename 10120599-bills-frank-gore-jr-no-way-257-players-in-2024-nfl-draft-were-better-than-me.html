"I feel like there's no way 257 people [were] better than me in this draft, but now that that process is over, I'm a Bill. I'm here to compete and I'm here to push my teammates and push the running back room and try to get on special teams."</p><p>Gore is the son of five-time Pro Bowler Frank Gore, who notably played one season with Buffalo in 2019. His father rushed for 16,000 yards, and now Gore will try to live up to that legendary career.</p><p>He played four seasons for Southern Miss, rushing for 4,022 yards and 26 touchdowns while also recording 692 receiving yards and four touchdowns. He was rated as the No. 296 overall player and the No. 25 running back in the 2024 NFL Draft by <a href=#>Bleacher Report's NFL Scouting Department.</a></p><p>He enters a Bills team that already had James Cook, Ray Davis, Ty Johnson and Darrynton Evans on the <a href=# rel=noopener>depth chart</a>. Davis was notably a fourth-round pick in the 2024 Draft.</p><p>Still, Gore said he is "here to prove people wrong" and will get the chance to potentially do so for a team that has won four consecutive AFC East titles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmWCeoWMm6ClpKNis7OtzaRkoKeimnqrvoynpmavka56c4GWZqelmamav7R5yKdka2hiaXqvsstmm6uZlql6uLHRnmSbnaSpsrN506GYp2Wdmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
