The couple, who star together in an adorable Samsung holiday commercial, tell <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> they're complete "holiday junkies."</p><p>In the commercial, which Us has an exclusive first look at, the Parenthood actor, 39, and Veronica Mars alum, 34, emulate their real life and don matching Christmas ensembles and adorn their home with everything from fake snow to popcorn garlands.&nbsp;</p><p>"Being in the holiday campaign is even better because we are both complete and utter holiday junkies," Bell, who is expecting her second child, told <strong>Us</strong>. "Any excuse we have to celebrate a little more, it feels very natural to us! We're just showing people a snapshot of our real life."</p><p>And they're not kidding — Shepard says they even wear matching sweaters in their own home.</p><p>"It's literally our favorite season, our favorite time of the year," the funnyman said. "We start with wearing matching Christmas sweaters the day after Halloween. And matching for the entire family, so not only us but that includes our daughter [<strong>Lincoln</strong>] and the canines too. And again that's not bulls–t because you can go on our Twitter and see three years ago us fully clad in matching outfits with the dogs," he added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p>&nbsp;<p>Bell, who is visibly pregnant in the commercial and needs help tying her shoes, tells <strong>Us</strong> she's feeling "great" but when it comes to sleeping, her husband has a different opinion.&nbsp;<a href=#>See photos of Bell's maternity style.</a></p><p>"The nighttime gets a little dangerous," he joked. "It's like sleeping next to a giant wounded elk who's been hit by a semi and won't die — snoring, drooling, grunting, kicking, getting up and walking…The other night she was eating a big glass of ice cubes, like crunching very loudly as she did all those other things. That was a really great time."</p><p>Watch the cute ad above for yourselves!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJuasF2otaa8wKubZqCVob20ec%2BrnKCmkaPBbrfRoqqtnZ5ir6a4y2agp2WRmbyzrcGlnGarkaLAtrrGZp%2BopJmZrrp5wJ1ka2hhaX92fZA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
