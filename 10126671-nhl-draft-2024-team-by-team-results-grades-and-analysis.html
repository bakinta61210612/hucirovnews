Second-round pick Igor Chernyshov should add more offensive punch, alongside Celebrini.</p><p>Even though Will Smith doesn't technically count toward the 2024 class, the Sharks were able to <a href=# rel=noopener>sign</a> the No. 4 pick from last year's class in May to boost what could end up being one of the best young forward lines in the league within the next couple of the years.</p><p>The Sharks haven't had a lot of reasons to celebrate over the past five seasons with no playoff appearances or winning records during that span. This draft should turn all of that around very soon.</p><p><b>Worst Draft: Vegas Golden Knights</b></p><p>When you only have four picks in a seven-round draft, it's hard to come away with a great class. But the picks that do get made should make you feel confident about the future.</p><p>That can't really be said for what the Golden Knights did, particularly in the first round with Trevor Connelly at No. 19 overall.</p><p>On talent, there wasn't much argument that Connelly was a first-round player. B/R had him <a href=#>ranked</a> No. 18 overall on the final big board, earning praise for being a "phenomenal skater with tons of speed that allows him to create space for himself and for his teammates."</p><p>If you only look at the talent, there would seem to be no problem. But there are valid character concerns that make Connelly a significant risk to bet on with a top-20 selection.</p><p>The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Katie Strang and Corey Pronman</a> reported in February that Connelly was kicked off his amateur team in 2022 when he was 16 for posting a picture on Snapchat of a teammate sitting on the floor of a library with building blocks that were assembled in the shape of a swastika.</p><p>Strang and Pronman noted some people in the NHL were also aware of a 2021 incident in which Connelly was accused of directing a racial slur at an opponent. Connelly denied the accusation and his initial suspension was not upheld when the California Amateur Hockey Association ruled it could not corroborate the allegation.</p><p>Vegas general manager Kelly McCrimmon said after the first round the team was "impressed" with Connelly's talent and is "really confident we'll do everything we can to help this player be a great player and a great person."</p>Vince Sapienza <span class=acct>@VinceSapienza</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kelly McCrimmon on taking Trevor Connelly 19th overall in the NHL Draft, "We are really impressed with his talent."&lt;br>&lt;br>"I'm really confident we'll do everything we can to help this player be a great player and a great person..."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VegasBorn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VegasBorn&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHLDraft2024?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NHLDraft2024&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/1TpmMsSOa0">pic.twitter.com/1TpmMsSOa0&lt;/a></p><p>Given how many questions there are going to be about Connelly as he enters the NHL that have nothing to do with his talent, it's hard to feel good about the Golden Knights deciding to bet on him.</p><p>Another bad-vibes moment for Vegas during the draft, which doesn't technically count against the class, was trading goalie Logan Thompson to the Washington Capitals right before the second day of the draft began after he agreed to do an autograph signing for fans during the event that was took place at the Sphere.</p>Jesse Granger <span class=acct>@JesseGranger_</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Logan Thompson is a champ for staying to sign autographs and take pictures with fans 30 minutes after being traded. &lt;a href="https://t.co/sJ2QByxorT">pic.twitter.com/sJ2QByxorT&lt;/a></p><p>Trading Thompson isn't going to make or break the Golden Knights going forward, but it was one of multiple unfortunate moments for the franchise during a weekend that should have felt more celebratory.</p><p><b>Best Moment: Beckett Sennecke Going No. 3 Overall</b></p><p>It's rare to catch a truly honest moment of surprise on camera during a draft. Beckett Sennecke had one of the all-time great reactions when the Anaheim Ducks used the No. 3 selection to take him.</p>B/R Open Ice <span class=acct>@BR_OpenIce</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beckett Sennecke was SHOCKED when his name was called by the Ducks at #3 overall ðŸ‘€ &lt;a href="https://t.co/JsmBcSalf8">pic.twitter.com/JsmBcSalf8&lt;/a></p><p>The pick was a bit of a reach, with B/R having Sennecke ranked as the ninth-best prospect in the class. He was acknowledged as a late-riser thanks to a really good second-half performance for the Oshawa Generals.</p><p>Sennecke had 22 points in 16 playoff games to help the Generals reach the J. Ross Robertson Cup Finals.</p><p>Even though there wasn't a surprise to see Sennecke hear his name called early in the draft, it was delightful to see him land in a spot that he clearly wasn't expecting. If he becomes the player Anaheim believes warranted the No. 3 selection, it will only make the moment endearing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuDeH2Mp5%2BlZZSnrqfAjGtna2xdqbKiuYybsGaslZa6br7ErKylrKNitLOtw56qZpmemXqiusClsKyhow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
