And she was not a fan of the age difference.</p><p>Toya said the following to the Shade Room: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs single‚Ä¶I mean, hey. She‚Äôs young. You live, and you learn. I just want the best for my kid at the end of the day. It‚Äôs no shade against Lucci. I wish him the best, but I want the best for her. She I just want my daughter to be happy. I want her to get focused on her first and love, that‚Äôll come next.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1wkXDZB9E5/</p><p>One fan reacted to the interview by saying: ‚ÄúShe should‚Äôve said: I want a man for my daughter who will respect her publicly and privately. A man is closer to her age WITHOUT children. A man that will honor her love her and be a part of her happiness.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1u43_khEcK/</p><p>Another commenter stated: ‚ÄúLike parent should do. Yall mad because yall parents won‚Äôt share the damnn EBT CARD.. stop being mad at that little girl‚Ä¶ & why stop toys and ask her a million questions about her daughter.‚Äù</p><p>This backer wrote: ‚ÄúCan you teach other parents of the black community how to help their kids when they may be in need of some sort of financial help? These parents are throwing kids out at 18 and leaving them for deas.üôÑ‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1wblgshN54/</p><p>Where will Reginae go from here? It is hard to tell, but she seems to be in the mood for taking some time off at this point to focus on her coins.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Which is perfectly understandable too, all things considered.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekpMaiedaroKCgpGK0psDSZqmar12eu266xLBkoqakmr%2B3tcSwZJqmlGKyubzLmqCnq12staLAjKyfnmWRo7FuuMilZLCZqaOybsDHoqWkZZGXvLbAjKympp1dpLNuvsSgoKeZlWKwor7TnqmsZZyes6Z5wqGmopuVqHp0fZVsbmln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
