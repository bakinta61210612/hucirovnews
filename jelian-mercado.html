Tony Sarluca is the father of her unborn child. When they were in the eighth standard, they had their first encounter. They spent a lot of time together and grew close. Tony intended to advance their relationship, but she had other ideas. They ceased communicating when she began dating another man. After dating him for a year, they split up.

Throughout her pregnancy, her mother was a huge supporter, whereas Tony struggled to cope. In May 2016, she finally gave birth to Mateo. Tony made every effort to help her, but for a variety of unexplained reasons, he was unable to. He should have been able to help her and Mateo more, but he was unable to. Sadly, she revealed in a video that they split up in September 2017. Nevertheless, they continue to be close friends. As of right now, she hasn’t shared much information about her personal life because Mateo is her top focus.
