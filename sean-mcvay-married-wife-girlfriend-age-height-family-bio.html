More details about him can be found below.</p><h2><strong>Sean McVay Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>Sean McVay was born in Dayton, Ohio, United States of America, on January 24, 1986, the son of parents Tim and Cindy McVay.

Before graduating in 2018, he had a record of 39 receptions for 312 yards.</p><h2><strong><span id=Early_coaching_career class=mw-headline>Early Coaching Career</span></strong></h2><p>Sean McVay’s coaching career began in 2008 when he was appointed Assistant Wide Receiver’s Coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers under the leadership of Coach Jon Gruden. He demonstrated a high level of professionalism and capacity in his work and was promptly appointed Quality Control/Broadband Coach, overseeing the training of the United Football League (UFL) Florida Tuskers.</p><p>His reputation and fame grew so much that the Los Angeles Rams signed him to coach the team on January 12, 2017. At that time he was just 30 years old. With this move, McVay would go down in NFL history as the youngest head coach in the sport, replacing former record holder Lane Kiffin, who was 31 years old, 259 days old when he became coach of the Oakland Raiders in 2007. Sean McVay made his season debut as head coach on September 10, 2017, in the game against the Indianapolis Colts.</p><p>In the game, which took place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Sean led the Los Angeles Rams to a stunning 46-9 win over their opponents in a home game.

It might interest you, however, that although he has never been married, he has a lovely Ukrainian girlfriend named Veronika Khomyn with whom he lives in Los Angeles. They welcomed their very first son together in 2016.</p><h2><strong>Sean McVay&nbsp;</strong><strong>Height And Weight</strong></h2><p>One thing is for sure, the right body type especially for a sport like American football is crucial if an athlete hopes to succeed in this sport. Sean McVay stands at an average height of 5 feet 10 inches with a fitness mass of 84 kg (187 lbs). Although his height is not that bad, it could be a limiting factor that may not allow him to rise to the highest point in an NFL football career. This could be the reason why he chose a career as a coach instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwKatzWaknK6RrnqurdGroJ6cXay2p7GMoKCrpJantqa6w2aYoJ1dnbKqs8etZJ%2BZnZ65unnBoqZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
