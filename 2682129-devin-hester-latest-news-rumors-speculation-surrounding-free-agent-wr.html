Curran of CSNNE provided further information about the Pats' level of interest:</p>Tom E. Curran <span class=acct>@tomecurran</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pats kicked tires today on once-great return man Devin Hester. He was released by Ravens this week. Nothing looming, I'm told.</p><p>Hester was once the league's premier weapon on special teams. The 34-year-old University of Miami product tallied 19 career return touchdowns, 14 on punts and five on kickoffs, during time with the Chicago Bears and Atlanta Falcons.</p><p>A vast majority of those game-changing plays came earlier in his career, which is now in its 11th season. He scored 11 return touchdowns in his first two seasons. He's added only two since the start of the 2012 campaign, however.</p><p>Hester's diminishing impact was on display as the Ravens' main return man. He ranked sixth among 12 qualifiers in kickoff return average and 18th of 24 in punt return average this season. He didn't score any touchdowns in 44 total return opportunities.</p><p>It's worth noting the four-time Pro Bowl selection dealt with some lingering groin problems throughout the season. He told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Lee</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Baltimore Sun&nbsp;in early December his health had improved.</p><p>"This could be the healthiest I've been since the season started," Hester said. "It feels natural, it feels strong. I can move the way I want to, and that plays a big part in the return."</p><p>Hester also has experience as a depth receiver in the passing game. While he's caught 255 career passes, none of those have come since the 2014 season with the Falcons.</p><p>The Patriots bringing him in to see if he may be able to provide some lightning in a bottle for the looming playoff run doesn't come as much surprise. Rookie cornerback Cyrus Jones has struggled to protect the football with five fumbles in the return game.</p><p>Yet, it doesn't sound like New England is prepared to make a move for Hester at this point, based on Curran's report. Another team may be willing to give the formerly dynamic weapon a chance to prove himself for the last few weeks of the season, though.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-c.png border=1 alt width=160 height=27 align=bottom style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9wYmZ%2FennDnq2ipl2dsrTAxKtkpZmkmsC1ec2erqxloqq6sL7SZqqpnZOquaLAyKilZqulp7%2Bwwc2doKefXZu%2FprGMmp6epqRixLM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
