When she was seven years old, her family relocated to New York City, where she pursued her dreams by studying acting at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Professional Children's School of Manhattan</a>. Her mother, Sosie, is an established restaurateur and chef at the <i>North Carolina OBX </i>and <i>Millie's Diner</i>, and her father sadly passed away in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>Her television debut was at the age of fourteen when she appeared as a contestant on the hit reality show <i><a href=#>MasterChef </a>Junior</i> in 2013. She wowed the judges and viewers with her skills and spunky attitude and managed to nab 8th place and a foot into the door of showbiz. Her next appearance was alongside comedian <a href=#>Louis C.K </a>on the hilarious sitcom <i>Louie</i> the following year. However, the role that gained her the most recognition is her contribution to the ominous episodes of the <i>Netflix </i>series <i>Ozark.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/eba1aada50ae6883.jpg><h3>How old was Sofia Hublitz in Ozark season 1?</h3><p class=align-left>Ozark is a dramatic crime series that first aired in 2017, making the accomplished young actress sixteen at the time of its release. She reportedly earns <a href=#>$10 thousand for each episode</a> of this popular<i> <a href=#>Netflix</a></i> feature. The cast of <i>Ozark</i> were twice nominated by the <i>Screen Actors Guild Award </i>for "<i>Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series</i>" in 2019 and 2021.</p><p class=align-left>Sofia plays the headstrong and troubled fourteen-year-old Charlotte Byrde, who is the daughter of the money-laundering couple Marty (Jason Bateman) and Wendy (Laura Linney). Charlotte has endured a great deal throughout the series, from wanting to be free of her parents to getting involved in the world of narcotics by assisting them.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sofia Hublitz</a>' movies and TV shows</strong></h4><ul><li><i>Ozark </i>(Charlotte Byrde) - 2017-2022</li><li><i>Ida Red </i>(Darla Walker) - 2021</li><li><i>What Breaks the Ice</i> (Sammy) - 2020</li><li><i>Horace & Pete</i> (Young Sylvia) - 2016</li><li><i>Louie </i>(Danielle Hoffman) - 2014</li><li><i>MasterChef Junior</i> (8th place) - 2013</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9c613986236d1f1a.png><h3>What happened to Sofia Hublitz' Instagram?</h3><p class=align-left><a id=https://biographytribune.com/who-is-sofia-hublitz-her-bio-husband-net-worth-family-affair-boyfriend/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sofia Hublitz</a>' social media accounts were quite influential, with over 78,000 Instagram followers alone. Unfortunately, and for no apparent reason, the stunning actress deleted her Instagram account in 2020, shortly before the release of the third season of <i>Ozark.</i> We hope that she will show her beautiful face on the platform again in the future, but for now, you can still follow her on <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a></i> and <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook.</a></i></p><p class=align-left>One could speculate that she deactivated her account to avoid all the <i>Ozark</i> fans' negative comments about Sofia's character, Charlotte. However, with comments such as "whiny and annoying" alongside your name, we do not blame the youngster for putting some boundaries in place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/cc5c6ae30e9b583b.png><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sofia Hublitz</a> is just 22 years old and already making a name for herself in Hollywood.
