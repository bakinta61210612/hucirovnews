"When I started doing her hair a couple of months ago, we talked about going lighter again," Wright, who owns <a href=#>Style House Salon</a> in Nashville, told Us.</p><p>For the "Little Red Wagon" singer's latest visit to Wright, he said there was no question what shade she wanted. "We were on the same page," the stylist shared. "I was like, 'Let's go really blonde again,' and she said, 'Yeah, yeah!'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>So what exactly did he do to Lambert's tresses to get them so light? Wright explained that he went heavy over the highlights she already had. Plus, he upped her base color a bit. "It's a very bright, dimensional blonde," he told Us.</p><p>And how did the singer, who announced her divorce to her ex-husband of four years, <strong>Blake Shelton</strong>, last month, react when she was all dyed and done? "When I got done blow-drying her hair, I spun her around, and she said, 'I love it!'" he revealed.</p><p>Although Lambert broke down while performing in the days surrounding her divorce, Wright dished that she appeared in good spirits. "She seemed great, and she looks awesome!" he shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmZ6ZpanGcLrEsKpopZmnrq%2BwwGajmqWSmr%2B1eceaoKurpK65qr%2FTZquapJuoeqO%2ByKCfrWWSobyvsMRmn5qhomKwsLjOq2RraGFqf3KE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
