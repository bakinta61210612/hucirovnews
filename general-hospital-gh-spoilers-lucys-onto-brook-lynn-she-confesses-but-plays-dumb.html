But Brook Lynn will pull off the astounding feat of confessing and playing dumb at the same time!</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers – Brook Lynn Quartermaine Blackmailed By Her Grandmother</h3><p>Brook Lynn was blackmailed to be a corporate spy at Deception Cosmetics by her grandmother, Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) for getting Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) reinstated at the PCPD. Tracy has threatened to tell Chase the truth if Brook Lynn doesn’t do the spy job, specifically related to the new product, “The Deceptor”. Brook Lynn showed up at Maxie Jones’ (Kirsten Storms) office, where Maxie’s assistant had suddenly quit and she was totally overwhelmed with papers all over her desk and had brought lunch.</p><p>Brook Lynn made reference to how Maxie and Lulu Spencer (Emme Rylan) used to have lunch together at work and Maxie had to go check on something and excused herself. Brook Lynn then put a flash drive into Maxie’s computer, which was still signed in, downloaded a file on the product and delivered it to Tracy.</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Brook Lynn Quartermaine (Amanda Setton)." width=800 height=529 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/07/general-hospital-gh-spoilers-lucys-onto-brook-lynn-she-confesses-but-plays-dumb/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital (GH) Spoilers: Lucy’s Onto Brook Lynn, She Confesses But Plays Dumb?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GH-Brook-Lynn-Quatermaine.jpg></p><h3>General Hospital Updates – No, Maxie Jones Wouldn’t Do This</h3><p><a href=#>Lucy later realizes that someone has downloaded</a> confidential records on the Deceptor, even though Brook Lynn had made a copy; at first, Lucy thought Maxie, until she realized Maxie has it. &nbsp;Maxie herself was confused and suspicious when she returned to her office and Brook Lynn left the lunch they were supposed to eat together. Maxie had asked and found out Brook Lynn hadn’t clocked in to work that day so Lucy’s mentions at the office about the Deceptor file being accessed makes her wonder. Brook Lynn, who is hearing all this just becomes more and more nervous and figures she’d better come up with an explanation before she’s accused of it by Lucy.</p><h3>Covering Lies With Truth</h3><p><a href=#>Brook Lynn speaks up and covers hersel</a>f and Tracy by covering lies with the truth if that makes sense-it does to her; she says that she copied the file. Her reasoning was that she wanted to study it to do a better job and claims she didn’t know anything confidential was in it, namely protected trade secrets. &nbsp;She talks a good game, but the real question is whether Lucy and Maxie will believe her, especially considering what Maxie knows about her not being clocked in.</p><p>Maxie was so stressed at the time she just accepted the lunch date without question, never realizing how odd it was for Brook Lynn. Brook Lynn doesn’t know she checked up on her after but Maxie likely will question it.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with GH right now. <a href=#>Come back here often for General Hospital spoilers, news, and updates.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49wZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq15xqFkrKifnrmmvtJmo66bqah6sLrTqGSbqp%2BkuG642KelZquYmnqku82fnKyrlah6o8HTZqelmamoeqXBzJtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
