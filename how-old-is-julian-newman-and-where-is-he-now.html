The aspiring player enjoyed the privilege of having a basketball coach for a father and Jamie did a good job of putting him through the process</p><p>Jamie had Julian experiment with regulation-size balls. He also exposed him to matches with older boys in recreational leagues. Despite his tender age, Jamie put Julian through a rigorous training process; this feat started paying off when the youngster could make 100 free throws, 200 jump shots, and 200 floaters during his daily practice sessions.</p><h3><strong>His Middle School Stats Announced Him to the World</strong></h3><p>Julian Newman was just a fifth grader at Downey Christian School when he joined the academic institution’s middle school team as a point guard. He wasted no time in recording stellar stats of 91 points per game, which led the school to promote the youngster to their varsity team.</p><p>Playing outside the jurisdiction of FHSAA (Florida High School Athletic Association), the then 11-year-old point guard averaged 12.4 points, 4.3 steals, and 11 assists per game through his first three starts. With this record, he succeeded in leading Downey Christian to a 21–6 high and at the same time, leading the entire Florida State in assists.</p><p>As a sixth grader, the promising basketball player averaged a total of 17 points per game. High school sports website, MaxPreps, featured him in an article on the 19th of December 2012; the piece was titled, “Fifth Grader Starting For Florida Varsity Team.” In the same vein, recruiting website, ScoutsFocus uploaded a highlight video of the juvenile point guard on YouTube; the video, which went viral in no time, garnered over 3.5 million views.</p><p>The then “Fifth Grader Playing Varsity Basketball” soon started making national headlines in publications such as The New York Times and Sports Illustrated. He recorded appearances on the sets of popular shows like The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Steve Harvey, as well as Good Morning America. Perhaps the peak of his career as a varsity basketball player was when Orlando Magic invited him to play at half-time during their NBA game.</p><p>During his sixth grade in 2013, The Huffington Post labeled Julian Newman “The Best Sixth Grade Basketball Player You’ve Ever Seen”. As of then, the youngster was already averaging 13.6 points plus 10.5 assists per game. The year 2014 was when the Tampa Bay Times dubbed him “The Most Marketed 12-Year-Old Basketball Player In The World”.</p><p>In 2015, the child star who was then a seventh grader earned pride of place as the youngest basketball player ever to record a total of 1,000 career varsity points, finished the 2014–15 season with an average of 19.8 points, 3.2 steals, and 10.2 assists per game.</p><p>The 4th of October 2016 marked another career high for Newman at the MiddleSchoolHoopsTV camp when he scored 52 points in a match-up featuring Kyree Walker – top 2020 class recruit. After the highlights of the game were shared on YouTube, it earned over 13 million views. Newman went to do his senior year in Prodigy Prep.</p><h3><strong>Is Julian Newman Going to College?</strong></h3><p>After Julian Newman accomplished his graduation from Prodigy Prep, Orlando, Florida in 2020 there were speculations about his choice of college but this never happened to date.</p><p>In an interview session, his father, Jamie Newman, claimed his son received a total of 15 D1 offers, adding that Julian was looking to hone his skills playing overseas before the drafting. In his speech, Jamie listed the G-League, Australia, China, Italy, and Germany as some of the choices for the youngster. A week after his dad’s interview session, Julian said he would be choosing between G-League and Australia.</p><p>While many were quick to believe Julian, others labeled him a liar, saying he only opted to play overseas because he never received a single D1 offer. Julian appeared on a July 2020 Instagram Live video where he contracted both his and his father’s claims by saying he has plans to play overseas next year and was looking to Australia, Japan, and Spain.</p><p>The inconsistency in his statements triggered a lot of suspicions and in addition, there seemed to be no sign of any overseas team coming to sign him up and college wasn’t even in the offing. This was the last nail in the coffin, leading fans to conclude that all his purported offers were mere fabrications.</p><h3><strong>What Happened to Julian Newman?</strong></h3><p>It has become glaring that Julian Newman lied about his D1 offers, which, according to his father, totaled 15. Besides, the overseas teams he claimed were going to offer him lucrative contracts are nowhere to be seen as the young basketball player has been somewhat stationary since he finished high school in 2020.</p><p>Though there may still be hope for the 5 feet 7 inches tall basketball player to make it big overseas fans have totally lost hope.</p><h3><strong>Where is Julian Newman Now?</strong></h3><p>Since fans and the general public lost interest in Julian Newman because of his lies about his D1 offers and going to play basketball overseas, the young man seems to have receded from the limelight.</p><p>Some reports said he still practices basketball with his father’s Prodigy Prep in Orlando Florida and patiently waiting for what providence has in store for him</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLWww4yoo51lmah6q8HLopinZZ6axK6tzWaYp5xdrLWmvsRmoKxlmJp6r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
