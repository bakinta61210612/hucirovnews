Speaking about their relationship in the April issue of <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>, the 29-year-old Drinking Buddies star says her divorce from ex-husband <strong>Tao Ruspoli</strong> turned out to be a blessing in disguise — because it led her to Sudeikis, 37.</p><p>“I had grown up with Tao; we had just drifted. I felt I had something to prove. If you fall off a horse, you get back up. I am not a quitter. I hung on for as long as possible, until it was more hurtful to stay,” she explains to the magazine of her marriage to filmmaker Ruspoli, whom she wed when she was 19 years old. “I’m so grateful for the pain and the heartbreak. It gave me the courage to leave and brought me to the great love of my life.”</p><p>Sparks flew when Wilde and Sudeikis first met at the 2011 finale of Saturday Night Live — “He seemed to really see me, see through the bulls–t,” she says — but the two didn’t have their first official date until six months later. Wilde knew that night that she wanted to be with the Horrible Bosses actor; she was less sure, however, about his feelings for her.</p><p>“I thought, ‘He won’t be interested in me; I’m not a contender,'” she confesses to Marie Claire. “He was so cool, so funny — I was such a fan of his and had always fancied his speed and his intelligence. He’s a brilliant actor with a brain like lightning…I thought, ‘I’m not beautiful enough or his type.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She was wrong, of course. “On our first date, in New York City, we closed the restaurant down at 2 a.m.!” she recalls. “He didn’t kiss me, and I was madly in love. I was overwhelmed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>A year after that fateful night, Sudeikis proposed. And though Wilde recently said she hasn’t had time to think about planning their wedding, she already has a pretty clear picture of their future beyond “I do.”</p><p>“We’ve discussed all our ideals and hopes. I can’t wait for children. I’m open-minded about how many, but three, which I love, is like a little party,” the actress gushes. “He’s so good with kids…I’ve never before experienced looking at someone and thinking, ‘That’s who I want to raise a child with.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKaloaaerm7DyKWbnmWZYrGqsM2tZJ%2BdlaF6o7HArquinqWheqa6zq6eoWWWpL9ussiapZydXZ%2ButLvNZqqunJWeuKq%2FjGtnamthZoA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
