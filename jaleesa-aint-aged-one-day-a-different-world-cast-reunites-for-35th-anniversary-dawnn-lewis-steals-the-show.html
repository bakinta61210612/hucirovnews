Bell. The sitcom, which was on the air for six seasons, debuted on television on Sept. 24, 1987, and was created by Bill Cosby as a spinoff of “The Cosby Show.”</p><p>“A Different World” followed the lives of a group of students as they attended a historically Black college.</p><p>On Sept. 29, the cast all came together in Wilmington, Delaware, to commemorate the show’s anniversary and opened up about its impact on the Black community during a discussion panel at Wilmington Public Library. This panel was a part of the library’s “Chopping it Up”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series</a>.</p><p>Days following the event, actress Cree Summer took to her official Instagram account to give fans a preview of what occurred during the reunion.</p><p>Alongside behind-the-scenes clips of the cast, Summer shared a video of the group singing the iconic “A Different World’s” theme song, which was originally performed by Phoebe Snow, Aretha Franklin, and Boyz II Men, respectively.</p><p>In addition to the recordings, Summer also uploaded several photos of the cast. One appeared to have taken at the event, while another occurred at what looks to be a restaurant.</p><p>In the post that Summer shared on her Instagram page, she wrote the caption, “The Band Got Back Together @kadeemhardison @iamjasmineguy @darrylmbell@dawnn_lewis @bcharnele @wilmingtonlibraryde#godblessthefreaks #adifferentworld (camera emoji) by @elakephotos 35 Years and Still Going Strong.”</p><p>As Summer’s photos went viral, many expressed how youthful 61-year-old Dawnn Lewis, who portrayed the role of Jaleesa Vinson–Taylor, looked in the images.</p><p>“Jaleesa looks the youngest and she may be the oldest.”</p><p>“Ummm Jaleesa looks exactly the same! Love this!!! The crew!!”</p><p>“Jaleesa didn’t age at all.”</p><p>“Jaleesa ain’t aged NOT ONE DAY!!”</p><p>“Not Jaleesa looking 35.”</p><p>Among the previous responses, others brought up how much they loved the show. One wrote, “35 years!! They all look good! How is Jalisa looking 35 years old. Man I love that show.”</p><p>Another said, “One of the greatest shows of all times!” A third person stated, “The nostalgia was getting looking at this is unbelievable.
