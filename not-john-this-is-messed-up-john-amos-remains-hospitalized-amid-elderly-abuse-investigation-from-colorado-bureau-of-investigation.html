As of June 8, Amos had reportedly started to feel “100%” healthy after doctors were able to drain the fluid.</p><p>The GoFundMe account set up in his honor has now <a href=#>raised</a> over $12,600 out of its $500,000 goal. Shannon claims the money will be used to help his children travel from other states to see him.</p><p>After Amos initially denied his daughter’s allegations, she made a video stating that she was not “crazy” or “lying” about the safety and well-being of “The Roots” star.</p><p>“All due respect to my father’s response, I understand that this is embarrassing and upsetting and probably not what he would have wanted me to do but it is in his best interest,” she <a href=#>explained</a>.</p><p>Shannon admitted there’s more to the story though she “can’t name names” at the moment due to potential defamation allegations.</p><p>Fans were shocked once again after learning new details about “America’s Dad” and the state of his health.</p><p>“This is <a href=#>heartbreaking</a>.”</p><p>“Oh no! That’s awful. I hope he gets the safe and good care that he needs and <a href=#>deserves</a>!”</p><p>“There are way too many vile and malicious people on this planet.

The caption read, “Who can deny the bond a father & a son have for each other?”</p><p>A few social media users have expressed their suspicions about K.C., who regularly shares fun&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a>&nbsp;of their time together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49vZmprX6O8tXnJqJ%2BnZaSdtrR5yKxkpp2jqLKledSpZKOnmKN6ornOrGSrnZ2Wtq%2B%2FjKGmrKiZqa6ttdmem2aZnZ6xbrHLnZyrpKlirqPB0p5koqammsC1tcaaq6KnnmKzs7vMZpqopJ%2BnrqW7jJusq52Rqnqwsoyipa%2Bdo6m2qK3ToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
