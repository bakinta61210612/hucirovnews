Subsequent conclusions, though never quite as shocking, always had an element of drama: screaming matches, accusations, tears. At the outset of the season 6 denouement, twins <strong>Teresa Aprea</strong> and<strong> Nicole Napolitano</strong> seem poised to carry on that tradition.</p><p><span>With <a href=#><strong>Dina Manzo's</strong></a> Project Ladybug charity fashion show just hours away, the twins still have not cleared the air with Teresa G. (Quick recap: Teresa G.'s pal, <strong>Victoria Gotti </strong>revealed to the cookbook author and Amber Marchese that Teresa Aprea's husband Rino once told Victoria that he slept with Teresa Aprea's mom. Then Teresa Giudice told Dina the rumor, and word got back to the twins&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;via Amber's husband Jim&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;that everyone knew about the rumor. Got all that?) So while going over final preparations for the event with Dina, the twins make sure Victoria is not invited. Teresa A. then says for the umpteenth time "I deserve an apology." She also takes a cheap shot at the Giudices' well-known legal problems saying, "Teresa, you just s–t all over my family. I would never do that to you. That's why yours is getting destroyed now. Karma's a bitch."</span></p><p>Though Teresa A. is riled up, Amber has mellowed out. After Jim caused a ruckus in Boca Raton, Amber decides to go to the party solo and not risk round 2 of Jim versus the twins. "We don't want to cause trouble," Amber explains. Since when?</p><p><span>As the women all get ready for the bash&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;held at the twins' friend's mansion&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Melissa Gorga</strong></a> worries that the upcoming party could be "a ticking time bomb." Teresa G., meanwhile, has a moment of clarity, questioning why the twins haven't reached out before the party. "[Teresa A.] had two weeks to call me," says Teresa G., who wonders if Teresa A. just wants an "audience." (Not to mention Bravo cameras!) Dina tells her BFF she wants no drama: "If anything happens from here on in, whoever starts it will lose a friend."</span></p><p>When the party starts, Amber grabs Rino to chat about her role in the drama. "I like to forgive and forget and move on," Amber explains as she and Rino literally kiss and make up.</p><p>The twins, however, seem like they're looking for a fight. "I think we need to talk," Teresa A. says to Teresa G., as Melissa and Nicole look on. Teresa A. says Teresa G. should feel "ashamed" for repeating that rumor. But Teresa G. doesn't back down, trying to explain that neither she nor Victoria were gossiping. Teresa A. continues to try to bait a cool and calm Teresa G., calling Victoria Gotti "trash" and an "animal." Still calm, Teresa G. cuts her off and says "she's my friend." (Old Teresa would have flipped a table at this point and screamed "prostitution whore.")</p><p>When Teresa G. points out that Rino himself started the rumor since he told Victoria Gotti in the first place, Nicole jumps in and snaps, "Teresa are you that stupid?" Uh-oh. Remember what happened when <strong><a href=#>Danielle Staub</a> </strong>told Teresa G. to "pay attention, puh-leez"? Except this time, Teresa keeps her cool and replies simply, "I'm not stupid." That's all you got, Teresa?</p><p>Pretty much. The two Teresas hug it out with Teresa G. telling the twins, "I like you girls a lot… I wasn't trying to hurt you."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And with that, season 6 almost has a happy ending. Instead, the show flashes forward several months to October 2, when<strong> <a href=#>Joe</a></strong><a href=#> and Teresa Giudice are sentenced</a> to 41 months and 15 months in federal prison, respectively. "I feel like it's not real," says <a href=#><strong>Jacqueline Laurita</strong></a>, who, along with husband <strong>Chris</strong>, watches the news with Teresa's cousins, <strong>Kathy Wakile</strong> and <strong>Rosie Pierri</strong>.</p><p>While Jacqueline sobs, Nicole, who hears the news at home with boyfriend <strong>Bobby Ciasulli</strong>, isn't so sympathetic. "You don't mess with the legal system," she says. "Choices you make in life, there are consequences."</p><p>Tell Us: what did you think of season 6?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOq5yapF2dvLa%2FxLCgr52jYrynec2ermailafApsWMrJyaq5%2Bjend5xaKlmqSVYr%2Bmr8CpZK2doprAonnSoaawnJ%2Bsu25%2Bj2pranFhZQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
