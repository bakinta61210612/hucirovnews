Office of the Chief Medical Examiner recently reclassified the death of 40-year-old Sonya Champ from “undetermined” to “homicide,” making hers the first of the five deaths connected with Anthony Eugene Robinson to be definitively ruled a homicide, WRC reported.</p><p>Champ’s body was found on September 7, 2021 — before the bodies of the four Virginia victims were found. As CrimeOnline previously reported, evidence puts Robinson in the same area at the time Champ disappeared.</p><p>Robinson, 35, was arrested in November in North Carolina and charged with the deaths of 54-year-old Allene Redmon of Harrisonburg, Virginia, and 39-year-old Tonita Lorice Smith of Charlottesville, Virginia, whose bodies were found on November 23 in Harrisonburg.</p><p>He’s been linked but not charged with the deaths of&nbsp; 29-year-old Cheyenne Brown of Washington, D.C., and 48-year-old Stephanie Harrison of Redding, California, whose bodies were found near a hotel in Alexandria on December 15. Authorities are still trying to determine their cause of death.</p><p>Police believe Robinson met the women on online dating sites and lured them to hotels, where he killed them and moved their bodies in shopping carts.</p><p>Robinson is being held without bail in Harrisonburg, where he is charged with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of concealing, transporting or altering a dead body.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</strong></p><p>[Featured image: Anthony Eugene Robinson/police handout]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6i1sLzPoqWgZZOWv7V5yqKjpZ2iYruiucSdZKmdoqi8r3nOn2SipqSav6a%2F02agp2Wdqr%2BlsdFmpp9llGKwbsPOppinZZOntq6xjKilpaGemnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
