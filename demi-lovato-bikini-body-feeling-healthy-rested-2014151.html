The former Disney Channel star has remade herself following a 2010 stint in rehab. On Wednesday, Jan. 15 the star shared her healthier-than-ever figure in a photo lounging at the beach with the caption, "2014… feeling healthy, feeling rested.. Y'all ain't ready!!!! #NEONLIGHTSTOUR."</p><p>Lovato, 21, showed off her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> in a black bikini while preparing for her Neon Lights Tour, which kicks off on Feb. 11 in San Jose, Calif. The former X Factor judge recently confirmed she wouldn't be returning to the Fox competition show in an effort to focus on her music.&nbsp;</p><p>The Neon Lights Tour will feature X Factor finalists Fifth Harmony, British girl group and X Factor UK winners Little Mix, and X Factor UK alum Cher Lloyd.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lately the "Heart Attack" singer has been very open about her struggles with substance abuse, an eating disorder, and self harm.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was always there, but then I just acted on it at around 8 or 9 years old," she told Access Hollywood in December 2013. "I started overeating, compulsively overeating. I would bake cookies and then eat the whole pan. I went from doing that to being unhappy with my body. I went to just completely starving myself and that turned into throwing up and starving myself and it was just this crazy battle going on inside of me. It got really difficult [and] I would throw up, and it would just be blood and it was something that I realized if I don’t stop this, I am going to die.”</p><p>Lovato's openness has generated a devoted fan base, which recently landed her the Best Female Artist and Most Devoted Fan Base awards at the People's Choice Awards. She recently released a book of positive daily mantras called Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year and has signed a deal to pen a tell-all memoir.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaJuepZliubDCwK2mZpqZoLavtYybpp2xXZuyprjIp55moJWWubW02GapnqukmrFufo9qa2ptYQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
