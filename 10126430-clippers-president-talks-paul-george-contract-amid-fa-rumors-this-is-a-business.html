"We very much want to retain Paul, but we also very much understand and respect the fact this is a business."</p><p>Paul has until Saturday to decide on his $48.8 million player option for the 2024-25 season. The nine-time All-Star is eligible for a four-year extension worth up to $221 million.</p><p>"This is a business and the reality of the new CBA impacts teams like us," Frank said, per Youngmisuk. "When your better players are in their 30s and you're trying to build a sustainable roster, it impacts it.</p><p>"Like if there was no CBA, with [team owner] Steve Ballmer, it would be carte blanche. With the new CBA, it's not even about the money as it is how are you going to build a sustainable roster, maintain your tools to have transactional flexibility? And with that comes really, really hard decisions."</p><p>The Clippers have made more than $365 million in luxury tax payments over the last three seasons, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a>. Last season, with the newly-installed second apron raising penalties for high-spending teams, the Clippers' $142.4 million bill made franchise history.</p><p>Los Angeles has previously had "extensive discussions" with George about a potential extension, especially before the February trade deadline, The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Amick and Law Murray</a> reported in May.</p><p>Those talks haven't led to anything yet. The Clippers' hopes that George will, like Kawhi Leonard, sign a deal below the maximum could lead to George hitting free agency on June 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuBdHyMnKOiqKCav7R5z6ucrKGUmru1edOao6SrXaWutriMoJyoqpeaeqS7za2pmpukYq6utcNmnZploqq6sL7SZquhoaNitrR5wGaZrquZo7K0vw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
