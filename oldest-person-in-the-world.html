How do they manage to live so long and what are their secrets to longevity?</p><p>In this article, we will explore the fascinating lives and achievements of the supercentenarians, the people who have reached the age of 110 or more.</p><p>We will also answer some of the most common questions about them, such as how old is the oldest person to ever live, who is the oldest person alive in 2023</p><p>So sit back and get ready to be amazed by these incredible stories.</p><h2><span id=How_old_is_the_oldest_person_to_ever_live>How old is the oldest person to ever live?</span></h2><p>The <a href=#>oldest person</a> to ever live and the oldest person ever (female) was Jeanne Louise Calment (b. 21 February 1875) from Arles, France who died at the age of 122 years and 164 days old.</p><p>When asked on her 120th birthday what she expected from the future, she replied:</p><p>“I expect a short one.” Born on 21 February 1875, she lived through world wars, the Spanish Flu, and even met Vincent Van Gogh in 1888.</p><p>Looking scruffy and smelling of alcohol, Van Gogh purchased pencils from Jeanne’s father’s shop and went on to paint his famous ‘Sunflowers’ in Arles.</p><p>Appearing as herself in the film Vincent and Me (Canada, 1990) at the age of 114, she is also the oldest actress.</p><p>Jeanne lived a fruitful life, taking up fencing in her 80s and continuing to cycle in her 100s, but passed away on 4 August 1997.</p><p>She claimed that her secret to long life was olive oil, port, and chocolate; she gave up smoking at the age of 120.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_the_oldest_person_alive_in_2023>Who is the oldest person alive in 2023?</span></h2><p>According to Guinness World Records, the oldest person alive in 2023 is Maria Branyas Morera (b. 4 March 1907), a US-born Spanish woman who is 116 years and 223 days old as of today.</p><p>She celebrated her most recent birthday in her nursing home in Fukuoka, Japan with some tasty cake.</p><p>Maria likes to keep her mind active, and on a normal day at the nursing home, she wakes up at 6 a.m. and in the afternoon often studies subjects such as maths.</p><p>One of Maria’s favorite pastimes is a game of Othello and she’s become an expert at the classic board game, often beating the staff.</p><p>Maria was born a year after her parents emigrated to the US.

Jeanne Calment is still the only documented case of a person living past 120 years, which many scientists had pegged as the upper limit of the human lifespan.</p><p>However, some researchers have suggested that there is no fixed limit to human longevity and that it may be possible to extend it beyond 120 years with advances in medicine and technology.</p><p>Some of the factors that may influence human lifespan include genetics, diet, lifestyle, environment, and social connections.</p><p>There are also some unverified claims of people living past 120 years, such as Li Ching-Yuen (b. c.1677), a Chinese herbalist who claimed to have lived for 256 years</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>The oldest person in the world is an amazing title that few people can claim.</p><p>It requires not only good genes but also good luck and good habits.</p><p>The oldest person to ever live was Jeanne Calment, who reached an astonishing age of 122 years and 164 days.</p><p>The oldest person alive in 2023 is Maria Branyas Morera, who is still going strong at 116 years and 223 days.</p><p>No one has lived past 120 years yet, but it may be possible in the future with scientific breakthroughs and better living conditions.</p><p>If you found this article impressive follow our blog for more interesting articles as shown below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLC4w56qrWWgmr%2B0u81moKdlpJ2ybsPOq6OdZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
