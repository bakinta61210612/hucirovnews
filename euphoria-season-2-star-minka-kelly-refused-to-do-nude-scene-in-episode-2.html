The hit HBO Max show continually makes headlines for a plethora of reasons, simultaneously captivating&nbsp;many viewers and deterring&nbsp;others with its provocative storylines and scenes. Hugely popular, season 2’s premiere&nbsp;boasts&nbsp;the title of highest&nbsp;digital premiere performance of an episode&nbsp;since&nbsp;the network’s&nbsp;launch, and the&nbsp;sixth episode of the season, titled&nbsp;<a href=#>“The Theatre and Its Double,”&nbsp;aired&nbsp;on HBO</a> February 20.</p><p>On the show, Kelly plays Samantha, the mother of the little boy&nbsp;who the&nbsp;ruthless yet vulnerable&nbsp;queen-bee, Maddy (played by Alexa Demie), babysits. As this season of Euphoria progresses, Maddy increasingly confides in Samantha about her struggles with her sociopathic ex-boyfriend Nate (Jacob Elordi) and the love triangle between herself, him, and ex best-friend Cassie (Sydney Sweeney). Samantha frequently offers comforting wisdom to Maddy&nbsp;and reveals relatable stories&nbsp;from her own wild youth.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Euphoria Season 2 Proves How Great Zendaya Really Is</a></span></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> magazine, Kelly&nbsp;disclosed that on her first day&nbsp;on the set of Euphoria, she&nbsp;filmed a scene that originally intended for Kelly’s dress to fall to the floor&nbsp;when Maddy unzips&nbsp;it after returning from a night out.&nbsp;In addition to feeling overwhelmed at the idea of such vulnerability while still brand-new to the set, Kelly felt that nudity for&nbsp;the scene was gratuitous and didn’t feel comfortable with proceeding. She requested that she instead remain clothed for the scene,&nbsp;telling director Sam Levinson, “I’d love to do this scene, but I think we can keep my dress on.”</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Levinson respected Kelly’s discomfort and obliged her request. The scene in question still maintains a&nbsp;charged intimacy between Maddy and Samantha, which further emphasizes the&nbsp;relationship between the characters as&nbsp;<a href=#>Euphoria&nbsp;explores its&nbsp;layered&nbsp;and growing intricacies</a>.&nbsp;Without any nudity, the moment reflects an&nbsp;intertwined&nbsp;emotionality of Maddy’s present as she relays it to Samantha, and Samantha’s past as she reflects upon it. The controversial and risqué&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;is no stranger to headlines about its nude scenes and other explicit content, with many questioning if such explicitness&nbsp;maintains a level so extensive that it’s rendered exploitative, to&nbsp;not only&nbsp;the show’s characters&nbsp;but&nbsp;their respective actors. The above incident told by Kelly notably mirrors a similar sentiment from&nbsp;Sweeney, for whom apparently&nbsp;an excessive amount of nude scenes were originally written into season 2 before she asked&nbsp;for them to&nbsp;be cut.</p><p>Furthermore, conversations&nbsp;continue to arise about&nbsp;Euphoria‘s&nbsp;disturbing emotional content that explores trauma, drug addiction, and sexual abuse, with&nbsp;many praising the actors’ performances and noting&nbsp;the value of&nbsp;the show’s venturing into previously taboo and stigmatized territory, while&nbsp;others&nbsp;argue that the show treats the issues (as well as the show’s&nbsp;marginalized characters) too callously and primarily values shock-value over evoking empathy. Either way, one can be certain that&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Euphoria</strong>&nbsp;will continue sparking conversation</a> and generating headlines with its addictively incendiary content. The last episode of season 2, titled “All My Life, My Heart Has Yearned for a Thing I Cannot Name,” will premiere on February 27.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Euphoria Season 2 Corrects & Improves Lexi After S1 Failed Her</a></span></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Peacemaker Ended The Suicide Squad (Because Batman Was Too Scared To)</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8inq56qpp6yuL%2BOnqypoJ%2BntqJ50p6YrKeeYn9uv9OaqWalmaO4onnKnqOlsV2nsqfB0p6bZqyfYrGwec2um55lo5iyr7GMoqVmnaCewLCwxGZpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
