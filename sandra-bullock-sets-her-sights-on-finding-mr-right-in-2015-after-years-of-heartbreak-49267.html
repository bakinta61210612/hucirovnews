Yet one thing’s still missing from the actress. “Sandra has everything a woman could want in life – except a good man,” confides a pal.</p><p>But 2015 might be the year that changes: Insiders say Sandra, 50, may be ready to meet her match. “Sandra’s attitude is that she’s happy the way she is, being on her own, but if the right guy came along – it would be icing on the cake,” shares the friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sandra-bullock-jesse-james.jpg><p>Sandra and her ex-husband, Jesse, in March 2010.</p><p>If her pals are particularly eager to see Sandra settled down, it’s because she’s often dated the wrong guys – especially her ex-husband, Jesse James, whose infidelity shattered their nearly five-marriage in 2010.</p><p>The breakup devastated her and made her more cautious about falling in love again. “She is not one to jump from one relationship into another,” the pal says. “She likes to be friends with men before allowing it to turn to romance.”</p><p><a href=#>Related Story: Sandra Bullock Comes to the Aid of Fainting Co-worker on Set of Her New Movie</a></p><p>Sandra’s most serious post-divorce relationship was with actor Ryan Reynolds, 38, but although he’s a great guy, they had different goals and they split in 2011. “He definitely wanted a house full of kids,” explains the friend about the actor, who just welcomed his first child with his wife, actress Blake Lively.</p><p>More recently, Sandra had a sizzle-and-fizzle romance with Chris Evans, 33. “It was more like a crush,” the pal says. “Chris is 17 years her junior, and while Sandra thought he was adorable, she felt it was a relationship that could never last.”</p><p>To read the full story on Sandra, pick up the new issue of ‘Closer Weekly,’ on newsstands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9KapZ2qkWKvtrjLqJqkZaOawbR5x56pZquZnLW1v4yopWaemaOxqrrGZqSrZaKetKnAjKKlZmpgZoJurcWtnKtlqZqus7%2BMqJ1moJWWv7Wu0Z6YpGVkbn93gw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
