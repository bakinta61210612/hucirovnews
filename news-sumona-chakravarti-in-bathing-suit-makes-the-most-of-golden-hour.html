The Indian actress shows off her amazing figure in a bathing suit while vacationing in Thailand in one of her latest social media posts. "Making the most of the golden hour," the gorgeous star captioned the Instagram post. How does she stay so fit? Read on to see 7 ways Sumona Chakravarti stays in shape and the photos that prove they workâ€”and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span>30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Sumona maintains that she sticks to a "simple way" to stay fit. One thing she does? "I go to gym thrice a week," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Tellychakkar</span></a><span>. Physical activity is anything that gets your body moving. Each week adults need 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity, according to the current </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</span></a></p><p><span>Also, "swimming four times a week" keeps her body toned and heart rate up. Swimming is a good way to get regular aerobic physical activity, according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>CDC</span></a><span>. Just two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity, such as swimming, bicycling, or running, can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses. In addition to the many physical benefits, there are multiple studies supporting the mental health benefits of swimming as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sumona describes herself as a "big time foodie," revealing that Chinese and Italian are her favorite cuisines. "I don't have any diet plan; I eat everything but avoid eating junk food, and have just homemade food," she told Tellychakkar. I am a hardcore non-vegetarian. If I go to a restaurant I don't waste money on vegetarian food," she continued. One big rule of hers? "I don't believe in the concept of sugar free. I have my tea and coffee with normal sugar."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/shutterstock_1226942971.jpg><p><span>Sumona eats small but frequent meals. "I also make it a point to eat in every two to three hours and never overeat," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I guess to live a healthy lifestyle the most important aspect is to have quality sleep, keep your body hydrated and never skip breakfast," Sumona told Tellychakkar. According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine men should drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day and women about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids.</span></p><p><span>Sumona also does pilates. "Even after 2.5 years of reformer pilates under @ruchikishore_ , she doesn't fail to push ur limits each time," she captioned an Instagram post. "Am relatively new with the pilates chair & trust me the easier it looks the scarier it getsâ€¦ The thighs were on ðŸ”¥ by the end of itâ€¦#pilatesgirl #chairpilates."</span></p><p><span>Sumona also loves to box. She posted </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this video on Instagram</span></a><span> of herself doing a boxing session with a trainer. "Work in progress. Life in progress. Slowly and steadily," she captioned it. "This kind of boxing has many health benefits, because it constantly requires you to think, change your position, and change your posture," physical therapist Linda Arslanian, director of rehabilitation services at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's hospital tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>."You're swinging your arms, moving the muscles of your arms and shoulders, increasing your upper-body strength. And when you're in the boxer crouch with a wide stance, with your knees slightly bent, you're strengthening your core muscles, back, and legs."&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkrK2dpLuiecKhmKSqkauus8DIZqCnZZKWwam1zaBkrK2ZqXqurcqeqmasmJp6rrvSrWSonl2cvK2wxKdkoaelp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
