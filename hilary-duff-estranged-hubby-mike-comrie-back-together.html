They were photographed laughing and enjoying the music together under the bright Cali sun, looking carefree and happy. Multiple sources have revealed&nbsp;that the parents to son&nbsp;<strong>Luca&nbsp;</strong>have yet to sign any divorce papers and&nbsp;are in no rush to split for good.</p><p><span>At Coachella this past Friday, the two were seen soaking in the music scene and sharing laughs. Duff looked pretty and summery in a white tank, shorts, brown fedora, and carrying her new Chanel bag. Comrie was also dressed casually for the festival and the heat in shorts, sneakers, and a t-shirt.</span></p><p>Their latest hang-out came one day after the two met up at the Chanel store in Beverly Hills. Duff purchased the bag worn to the music festivals during this visit to the luxury boutique. She&nbsp;<a href=#>shared an Instagram pic</a>&nbsp;of the beautiful tan and silver quilted purse with chain link strap.</p><p>As stated, neither Comrie nor Duff have taken legal steps to separate. Neither Duff nor Comrie have filed legal documents to move their split forward since announcing their separation on Jan. 10. In fact, the two even went on vacation together with their son for Valentine’s Day.</p><p>The couple original split, rumors said, from Comrie’s lack of putting effort into their marriage. The actress and the former NHL player were in counseling for 18 months before parting but insiders revealed that Comrie wasn’t putting the work in or trying anything the couple was learning in therapy.</p><p>In their split announcement back in January, Duff’s rep said, “They remain best friends and will continue to be in each other’s lives.”</p><p>Hopefully, the couple can continue moving forward positively and reunite, as they share a young son together and make a cute, smiling couple.</p><p>(Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGifoqSRp8ZusNSfnWado6m%2ForrGnptmoKWXr7p5zKKinmWTpLqztcRmmZqbm2LBsLPErZ%2Beql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
