It’s Easter Sunday I know y’all clean for real at the church. 😏#lecheminduroi #bransoncognac #bellator.”</p><p>One of his followers did not really like the vibe and wanted to remind the world that the Power actor has a bad relationship with his first-born, Marquise Jackson, who is 21 years old.</p><p>The commenter replied: “Imagine how your first born feels seeing this smfh your a piece of sh*t for real … Cant even be a dad for the one that actually looks like you … Straight joke.”</p><p>The message went viral, and many sided with the woman. 50 Cent was not having it and struck back with: “F*ck bitch you don’t know sh*t about what you. Everything was positive then you come with bullsh*t. Go suck a d*ick.”</p><p>After the entertainer’s aggressive response, the follower did not back down and still answered him with: “Damn @50cent I didnt mean to get you so mad 😂😂 I know the truth hurts but man up … You’re acting just like your son 69.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwjGRwInGnx/</p><p>At this point, it is clear that this Instagrammer is not the type to give up and some are applauding her for going toe-to-toe with one of the most famous trolls on the Internet.</p><p>One follower chimed in with: “Hey Katie! Look at @theshaderoom and read the comments. Everyone there agrees with you. You hit home when you told 50 the truth that’s why he got mad just like a typical deadbeat. Happy Easter.”</p><p>A second one continued with: “Fifty will always be fifty with his clapbacks💯 sending positive vibes yo way on this Easter Sunday tho👌 stay blessed.”</p><p>Another person decided to defend the founder of G-Unit by stating: “Your straight fucking ignorant! Why act like you know of or even understand this mans life….. get over yourself…. but then again you gain clout right???”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Who is right in this exchange?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGdlZXqksc2tZJ2qkZzAbrrOp2SfmZ5ixKm7jJyYpaSVmXqptcxmpq6sXZaztbHRZp%2BeZaCkwLWxw2aYnaeilq%2BtsYypoJyspaeybsPIrZ9mq5%2BjerS10Z5ko5mToMCwuoyiq2aZnKF6qa3DZquoZZSkeri106FkppmipsKqv8RmaXBsYG2CcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
