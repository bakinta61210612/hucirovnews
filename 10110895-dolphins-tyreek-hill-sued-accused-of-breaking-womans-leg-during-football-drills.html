The hit by Hill knocked her to the ground and resulted in her leg being broken.</p><p>Hall signed her child, who is an offensive lineman, up for Hill's football camp last May, and the wide receiver eventually flew her out to his home just outside of Miami, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Hill reportedly invited Hall to participate in football drills.</p><p>The wide receiver told her to adopt a defensive line position and rush at him as if she was going after a quarterback, per the lawsuit. Hall "did as instructed and on contact with the defendant, caused Hill to be pushed backwards, garnering laughter from the witnesses present at the time, including the defendant's mother, sister, friend and trainer," the lawsuit states.</p><p>Hill then became angry, and after switching positions so he was a pass-rusher and she was an offensive lineman, he "charged into" Hall with "crushing force" that resulted in her right leg being broken, according to the lawsuit. She says she needed reconstructive surgery and months of physical therapy on her broken leg.</p><p>The lawsuit states, per the <i>Daily Mail</i>:</p>"Tyreek Hill, a National Football League superstar, perennial Pro Bowler, First Team All-Pro and world class athlete nicknamed the 'Cheetah' for his incredible combination of strength and speed, makes his living humiliating and outperforming his competition on the football field."Unfortunately, after getting 'humiliated' in front of friends and family when he was knocked backwards during a friendly football lesson by his friend Sophie Hall, Tyreek became enraged and forcefully and purposefully shoved Ms. Hall, severely fracturing her leg."<p>Hill was traded to the Dolphins ahead of the 2022 season following six years with the Kansas City Chiefs. He's coming off a 2023 campaign in which he caught 119 passes for 1,799 yards and 13 touchdowns in 16 games.</p><p>The 29-year-old hasn't released a statement regarding the allegations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWWFeoGMnaalqJieu7R507Kpnp2bYrWquMtmqq6dlGKupK%2FUrJydZZ%2BbeqO%2BxJqioqaXYsSwucCnqmaklZx6pcHRoqWgZZakvLWuwKWjZpyinrmtvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
