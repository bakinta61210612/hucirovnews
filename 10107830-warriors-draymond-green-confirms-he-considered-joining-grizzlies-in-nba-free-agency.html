The Michigan State product would have fit the Grizzlies as a physical defender who isn't afraid to mix it up with opposing teams and dominate games in ways other than scoring the ball.</p><p>He is also accustomed to playing alongside a star guard in Curry and could have used some of those two-man-game skills in partnership with Ja Morant.</p><p>Yet he ultimately <a href=#>agreed</a> to a new four-year, $100 million deal with the Warriors, keeping him with the only NBA team he has ever known.</p><p>It's probably for the best for him considering Memphis is 18-31 and has dealt with several injuries, including a season-ending setback to Morant. The playoffs are a long shot at this point.</p><p>Golden State is also outside the playoff picture looking in at 21-24, although it is just a half-game back of the Utah Jazz for the play-in tournament. It has also won two in a row after defeating the Grizzlies in Friday's contest.</p><p>Green is back in the lineup after he was suspended twice earlier this season for putting Minnesota Timberwolves big man Rudy Gobert in a chokehold and then later hitting Phoenix Suns center Jusuf NurkiÄ‡.</p><p>Perhaps the stability and veteran leadership provided by having him back in the lineup will help the Warriors make a late run, which are things that would not have been available if he chose the Grizzlies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGyFdHyMsJirqpmkv7R5w6uYsqWfo7Fus9GenKdlk6S7p7XRpqpmoJVisLC60qKbnqqVmXqru8inoKefXZy%2FqsbZpaCeq12eu266wZpkn6qVmnqis8SnmrI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
