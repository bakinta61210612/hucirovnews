Born on October 8, 1980 to Beth and James Cannon, he was raised in San Diego, California. His mother was an accountant and his father a motivational televangelist. He was raised San Diego, and his parents were very present in his life. Despite his parents’ good careers, he still grew up in a bad neighborhood in which gangs were the norm and it was what most kids ended up doing with their lives. However, Cannon had no interest in being part of any gang, so he simply stayed away from them. He actually spent his time playing basketball, at which he was quite good. There was even a time in his life when he thought he might grow up to play basketball, though he did not and he actually ended up going another route in life.</p><p>He loved comedy, and that was where he really found his passions were held. He spent his entire life practicing, trying to get people to laugh and cutting up. His first break was on this father’s local cable program where he also worked, and it was pretty well-received. He left high school right after graduation and went straight to Nickelodeon, where he began his career as a warm up act for the studio audience. He made several guest appearances on their hit show “All That,” and thus began his career in television.</p><p>From the time he began his career there, he’d already had his own group called the “Da G4 Dope Bomb Squad,” and they actually had some real work. They opened for some major acts back then, including Will Smith, 98 Degrees and even Montell Jordan. Their career was really taking off, but it was Nick Cannon that was the real star of the show. He spent much of his time working on his music and his comedy, hoping he would get a big break. That’s when Nick Cannon began receiving roles in shows that required he host, which is something he is quite naturally good at. Over the course of the following decade, his fame grew through shows primarily aimed at kids.</p><p>He formed his own label and began signing music, and he became an instant hit when he was hosting his hit show “Wild n Out,” on MTV. He became the host of most every award show aimed at hot new artists and kids, and he became more and more famous. That’s when he began dating singer Mariah Carey. The couple married in 2008, gave birth to twins in 2011 and announced that they were going to divorce in 2014, though they remain committed to raising their kids together.</p><p>Nick Cannon has some health issues that caused him to spend some serious time in the hospital back in 2012. He suffers from something called lupus nephritis. He was hospitalized because of mild kidney failure and then again a few weeks later because of a pulmonary embolism. He continues to work on his comedy routine, his hosting duties and his other business ventures, but he puts being a father first in his life.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGilopubYrCius2opWamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
