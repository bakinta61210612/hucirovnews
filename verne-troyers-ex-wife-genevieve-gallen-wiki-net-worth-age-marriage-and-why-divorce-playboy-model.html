So, she initially worked as a freelance model, which led her to appear in the “Playboy” magazine, and worked in the positions of the Secretary at Active Real Estate, a Store Manager at The Straw, The Jar, and The Bean, as well as a theater artist at Detroit Institute of Arts, all of which added a considerable amount to her net worth.</p><p>Her academic qualifications have also helped her to expand her business as a private Iyengar yoga instructor, increasing further her wealth.</p><h2><span id=Genevieve_Gallen_Net_Worth>Genevieve Gallen Net Worth</span></h2><p>Although her career in different fields of life has been active for a while, she became popular with the public through her brief marriage to a famous actor, comedian and stunt performer Verne Troyer. So, if you ever wondered how rich Genevieve Gallen is, it has been estimated by authoritative sources that the total size of her net worth is over $500,000, accumulated mostly through her successful career as a freelance model as well as a Playboy model. Another source is coming from her job as an Iyengar yoga instructor.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life_Marriage_to_Verne_Troyer>Personal Life: Marriage to Verne Troyer</span></h2><p>Regarding her personal life, Genevieve Gallen reached enormous popularity through her marriage to the late Verne Troyer (1969-2018). He was a Hollywood actor, comedian and stunt performer, probably best recognized for being only 2ft 8ins (0.81m) tall. The couple tied the knot at a wedding ceremony held on the 22nd January of 2004, after two years of relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Genevieve-Gallen-1-677x1024.jpg><h3><span id=Divorce_after_a_Day>Divorce after a Day</span></h3><p>However, Genevieve apparently filed for divorce the next day – some reports suggest that it was Verne, through his lawyer stating that the marriage was just a publicity stunt. However, Genevieve stated that the main problem was that Verne was a sex addict and an alcoholic, who used to abuse her physically, hitting her with a bottle of vodka when he was drunk, although this reason seems suspicious given their marriage, and Troyer’s height.</p><p>It is believed that she is currently single. Her residence is in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_Vital_Statistics>Appearance and Vital Statistics</span></h2><p>Speaking about her appearance and physical attributes, Genevieve amazed a huge number of men when working as a Playboy model. She is apparently very attractive with long blonde hair and dark brown colored eyes. As a yoga instructor, she has a well-maintained body shape with a height of 5ft 6ins (1.68m), weight that is reputed to be around 132lbs (60kgs), and vital statistics of 34-29-36.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Presence>Social Media Presence</span></h2><p>In addition to her involvement in the entertainment industry, Genevieve is quite active as a member across many of the most popular social media sites, on which she frequently posts photos from her private life.
