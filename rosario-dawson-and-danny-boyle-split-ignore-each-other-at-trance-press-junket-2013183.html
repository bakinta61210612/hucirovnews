The actress, 33, and the Oscar-winning director, 56 began dating after production wrapped on their upcoming film Trance.</p><p>"From the outside it looks like there's a lot of dissimilarities, but we actually have a lot in common. We're really similar people. He's a very kind man," said Dawson, who told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> she made the first move during an October 2012 interview. "It was just one of those things where we were going to just go our separate ways had someone not said something."</p><p>Dawson described her then-love as a "really brilliant human being" and a "very, very lovely, kind man." British filmmaker Boyle — known for helming hits like Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and Trainspotting — declined to talk about their courtship during an interview with <a href=#>The Mail on Sunday</a>'s Live magazine March 2, though he did praise his ex for her lack of vanity.</p><p>Despite their kind words for each other, there was palpable tension when the two reunited for the Trance press junket in L.A. over the weekend, a source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "Rosario and Danny didn't interact during interviews," the source says. "It was pretty obvious they're no longer a couple."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The source adds, "He was talking to a group of people when she arrived and it was awkward — like a cold greeting, no hug, and they got through it as quickly as possible."</p><p>Prior to romancing Boyle, Dawson dated Sex and the City star <a href=#><strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Lewis</strong></a> for two years. Though they shared a pad in L.A., the actors separated in November 2006. Dawson also <a href=#>dated</a> French DJ <strong>Mathieu Schreyer</strong> from 2008 to 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmoq5GntrB5w5qurKeeYq6vsIydmKemqWKvsMXLnmSsqJyewW61xqemq51dmq6ktIyoq6GdomKutXnTq5inm5VivbOx0qxko62eoLK1eZFpaGxpaGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
