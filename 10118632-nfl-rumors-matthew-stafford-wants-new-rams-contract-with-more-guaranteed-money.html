"He believes he has a lot left. A little bit of a lingering issue this offseason for the Rams."</p><p>Stafford signed a four-year, $160 million contract in 2022, with $130 million of that being guaranteed money.</p><p>Stafford had 3,965 passing yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 2023 and was just shy of beating the Detroit Lions in the wild-card round of the playoffs.</p><p>Stafford helped lead the Rams to a Super Bowl in 2021 and has been a valuable addition since joining Los Angeles, but his age could pose a risk for giving him a big contract. While the 36-year-old is still performing well, he could begin tapering off and leave the Rams in a bind financially.</p><p>It's not clear whether Stafford is prepared to hold out over a new contract, but the discussion will give Los Angeles another problem to solve this offseason.</p><p>If a holdout from Stafford is on the way, the Rams could be in a bind to start the year. They picked up Jimmy Garoppolo to serve as a backup, but if Stafford doesn't play to start the year, Garoppolo won't be able to suit up as he will be serving a <a href=# rel=noopener>two-game suspension</a> for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy.</p><p>In the meantime, Los Angeles will look to reach an agreement with Stafford to avoid that scenario and keep its starting quarterback happy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2DdH6Mp52lZaKqurC%2B0makmqyknbK4edKtmJ%2Ben6exbsPAp6usZZ6axG6%2BwKaqZpufo8GzrcKtZLChpJ16rrvRnmSgrZGnrq%2FAxJ6bZqWfo7K6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
