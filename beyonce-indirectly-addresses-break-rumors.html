During the altercation, which was caught on security tape, the superstar’s sister attacked Jay-Z, scratching him and appearing to scream at him – there was no audio on the security footage. Following the altercation, the three came out with a joint statement in which they shared with the public that as a family, they don’t always get along, and that things are fine in their family.</p><p>Since then, the couple has been in the spotlight even more so than usual as onlookers bet on their marriage. During their joint tour, On the Run, the couple perform a song together called, “Resentment,” in which she dons a wedding gown and sings a lyric, “Been ridin’ with you for six years,” that Beyonce changed the lyrics to during a recent performance. She exchanged six years for 12 years, which is the number of years the couple has been together, further fueling the rumors that their marriage is in trouble.</p><p>While neither one of the power couple has made any announcement surrounding the status of their marriage, Beyonce has been making sure that the world knows her marriage is just fine. Her latest response to cheating and divorce rumors is a passive aggressive one she posted to Twitter. Beneath a photo of Jay-Z holding the couple’s daughter, Blue Ivy, walking on the beach she wrote, “My favorite hue is Jay Z Blue,” as a way of showing fans she’s perfectly content and happy where she is in her marriage.</p><p>The picture came just a few hours after yet another media storm let loose stating that she was spotted shopping for a new apartment without her husband, which now has fans believing she’s leaving him.</p><p>(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiZnrGfo7Cmecinm6KqlZjBrcWMmpudqpWowKa%2FjJupnpmbYr%2B2uc6rqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
