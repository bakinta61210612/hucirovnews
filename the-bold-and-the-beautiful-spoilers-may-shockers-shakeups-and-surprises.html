Hope Spencer (Annika Noelle) delivers shockers, RJ Forrester (Joshua Hoffman) will shake things up at Forrester Creations, and you can always count on surprises with Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown)!</p><h3>The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Shockers</h3><p><a href=#>Hope, shockingly looks to be in the process of becoming obsessed</a> over Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) instead of the other way around. This of course is making things rocky between her and Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) and causing confusion at work. Then there are more shockers with her mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) seeming drawn back to Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) in spite of her pact with Taylor Hayes (Krista Allen).</p><p>Will mother and daughter behave themselves, or will they sleep with father and son and ruin their other relationships? Will Brooke throw her friendship with Taylor out the door and run back to Ridge while Hope seduces Ridge and Taylor’s son?</p><h3>B & B Spoilers: Shakeups</h3><p>There are a lot of shakeups ahead for viewers in the month of May, with Brooke and Ridge’s boy RJ Forrester newly arrived. It looks like he and Thomas will clash and that could cause more drama between Brooke and Taylor. More couple shakeups could happen now that Bill Spencer (Don Diamont) has told the truth that he and Sheila were nothing but an FBI sting-he’s already crossed some other lines. He’ll continue to try and win Katie Logan (Heather Tom) back and act like Carter Walton (Lawrence Saint-Victor) doesn’t exist; it looks like he’ll keep trying to ignore she’s moved on. Nevertheless, Katie seems torn between her past with Bill and her future with Carter, and the bad boy might win her back in spite of her reservations, Bill will do anything.</p><p><img alt="The Bold And The Beautiful: Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown)" width=800 height=455 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/04/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-may-shockers-shakeups-and-surprises/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: May Shockers, Shakeups, And Surprises" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/BB-Sheila.png></p><h3>The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Surprises</h3><p><a href=#>While there are always surprises with Sheila</a>, who’s currently finding her only friend Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) can’t and won’t bust her out of jail, there’s always something around the corner. While “Dy-No-Mite” Jimmie Walker is making a couple of guest appearances in early May, it doesn’t sound like he’s going to play the returning character that’s been teased. However, whoever the returning character is, it sounds like he or she will also really shake things up and possibly cause trouble, meaning it could be someone connected to Sheila.</p><p>It could also be another Forrester family member who hasn’t been home in a long time and shake things up between Eric Forrester (John McCook) and Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis). On the other hand, maybe it’s a Logan – whatever happened to Wyatt Spencer’s (Darin Brooks) fiancée, Flo Logan (Katrina Bowden)-maybe she’ll finally get a story!</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with B & B right now. <a href=#>Come back here often for The Bold and The Beautiful spoilers, news, and updates.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49tZq2glWKvsLjDZpinnF2ptaZ5wZ6YrqyZm8KtedKppqKklafAbrnAsmSsoJ%2BYuKa%2B0maqoZmbmsKxv4yapZ1lo6q%2Fsb7IrJysZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
