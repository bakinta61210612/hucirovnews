Capitec customers must be aware that the reasons for disputing debit orders are:</p><ul><li>Your Capitec banking app was used without your knowledge.</li><li>Being billed more than once for online purchases.</li><li>If you made a payment error.</li><li>Or you were misled into making a payment.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It is imperative to note that should a customer dispute a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">valid debit order</a>, unfortunate circumstances will likely result. These include being handed over for bad debt, difficulty entering into other agreements, a cancelled insurance policy, and unpaid instalments.</p><h3>How to reverse money using Capitec App not debit order</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7838e79b20a826c7.jpg><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, an option to reverse money that is not a debit order is unavailable on the Capitec App. Customers can visit Capitec branches nearest to them for assistance.
