Back in 2003, the Charlie Countryman actress was chosen as one of nine young starlets to appear in the magazine’s Young Hollywood issue, an experience she recalls now, at age 27, with absolutely no fondness whatsoever.</p><p>On Wednesday, Oct. 15, a fan tweeted a photo from the VF spread with the caption “Never forget,” tagging Wood and several of her fellow cover girls including <strong><a href=#>Amanda Bynes</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Mandy Moore</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Hilary Duff</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Alexis Bledel</a></strong>, <strong>Raven-Symone</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a></strong>. (The monumental pull-out cover also featured <strong>Mary-Kate</strong> and <strong>Ashley Olsen</strong>, along with the valley girl-inspired headline, “It’s Totally Raining Teens! And It’s, Like, So a Major Moment in Pop Culture.”)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Responding to the tweet, Wood made it clear that she hadn’t forgotten. She even shared some of her memories of the shoot in a series of follow-up posts.</p><p>In them, she recalled being “close to tears” afterward, saying she “wasn’t comfortable” and “felt like meat.” She also said there was pressure to “shut up and do what you are told.” Read her tweets below.</p><p>I was almost in tears after this shoot. They tried that dress on me, I wasnt comfortable but they told me there was no time– <a href=#>@katiexwright</a></p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><p>— cause everyone else took up too much time with their fittings. Then I was given a choice on whether I– <a href=#>@katiexwright</a></p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><p>–wanted to wear flats or heels. I chose flats and was immediately handed heels and told they looked better. Then we were– <a href=#>@katiexwright</a></p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><p>–all lined up, stared at and approved. I was 15 and felt for the first time my identity being erased and the pressure– <a href=#>@katiexwright</a></p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><p>— to shut up and do what you are told. I felt like meat. Since then, I have found my voice. Never again. <a href=#>#neverforget</a> <a href=#>@katiexwright</a></p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><p>Side note , I have shot the cover of “vanity fair” since and had a much different experience. It was quite lovely. ????</p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><p>I begged for pants. “<a href=#>@YouWonScience</a>: <a href=#>@katiexwright</a> I’m surprised any of you were allowed to wear pants, ridiculous”</p><p>— Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood) <a href=#>October 15, 2014</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>I think when you are young and inexperienced and shy you can be bullied more.
