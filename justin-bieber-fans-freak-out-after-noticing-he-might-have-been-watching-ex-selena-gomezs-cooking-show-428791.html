Little did he know when he shared that detail about him, was that fans would start a huge theory on the internet that he had been watching his ex, <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>’s cooking show!</p><p>The reason why many speculated this, was that the singer’s pic showed on the screen of his TV, Selena’s show being one of the productions on screen.</p><p>As you can imagine, <a href=#>Justin</a>’s followers started chatting about it and concluded that he must have been tuning in to his former girlfriend’s latest project.</p><p>Even though Justin Bieber is married to supermodel Hailey Baldwin, it appears that not even now can he escape his past with <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> because people could be bringing it up at any moment!</p><p>After all, there are many who disregard the whole marriage thing and continue to ship Jelena, insisting that Justin and Selena are meant to be!</p><p>So you can imagine how happy seeing Selena’s show on Justin’s screen made a lot of people online.</p><p>It definitely gave them some hope he still wants to see her face and might even miss the fellow singer!</p><p>Obviously, it sounds like quite the stretch from just that one detail they noticed but they still freaked out about it.</p><p>One fan tweeted that ‘Justin Bieber accidentally slips up and reveals he’s been watching Selena Gomez’s cooking show! Thoughts?’</p><p>However, while it might look, at first, like Justin was tuning in to watch Selena’s show, in reality, the cooking program was merely in his recommended, not his watchlist!</p><p>This is also something a lot of fans mentioned in defense of the performer.</p><p>https://twitter.com/PopCravesMusic/status/1295483271988617219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295483271988617219%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhollywoodlife.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fjustin-bieber-hbo-max-photo-watching-selena-gomez-cooking-show%2F</p><p>Still, some criticized him for sharing the pic on his IG Stories in the first place, even though he must’ve known that it would cause quite a stir.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘To be honest, it is not on his watchlist. But, it is weird he took the picture and showed Selena’s cooking show when he knows the world will talk about it,’ one user tweeted.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeaqsC1tc1mmaKdkpq%2FbrLAp6pmnqKarqx5zq6rZpmWqbKzec2oq6KbmaO0brTEZqSin5ipeqmt1Z5km52Vo3q4rdOcn6Kml2KyuXnSnqOeppFitLC5xLOqZpufpLiqusZmqqGnp2KBc4SWcmho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
