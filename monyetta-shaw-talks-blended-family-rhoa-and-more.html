The children’s book author recently sat down with ESSENCE to discuss her life as a married woman and matriarch of a blended family.</p><p>“I’m enjoying married life thoroughly,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Monyetta</a> told the magazine. “I really am,” she added. “We were together some years before but it’s nice to be married and just have that connection and [say], ‘This is my husband. I’m your wife.’ It just feels really, really good. And to be able to blend our families together and make it work and just be there for one another is such a great thing.</p><p>Monyetta Shaw tied the matrimonial knot between her and Heath Carter after several months of courtship. The couple wed in Atlanta, Georgia, last November. Monyetta’s kids, Mason and Madilyn, joined Heath’s two children, Gigi and Brianna, at home.</p><p>“People talk about the compromise of marriage, but yes, it’s real,” Monyetta told <a href=# rel=noopener>ESSENCE</a> of her and Heath’s life at home. “From the smallest things, you have to take a moment and just think, ‘Okay, well, that’s not necessarily how I feel about it. Let’s discuss this and compromise.’ It’s a real thing.”</p><p>Open communication is how <a href=# rel=noopener>Monyetta Shaw</a> harmoniously co-parents with her children’s father, Ne-Yo, and his wife, Crystal Smith. “This is definitely a never-ending process, but you have to communicate and just keep the lines of communication open,” the celebrity mom told the press. “[By] integrating the kids, you just have to let them know that there are more people to love,” Shaw added. “Come from that aspect. That’s definitely what we did. And just take your time with it.”</p><p>Fans get to see snippets of Monyetta Shaw’s life on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Real Housewives of Atlanta (RHOA)</a>. The author is not yet a regular on the hit Reality TV show. Monyetta is, however, a supportive friend who is willing to share portions of her life with viewers.</p><p>“I definitely want to be true to myself, so I give a lot of myself, but not too much because I’m not one of those oversharers,” Monyetta told ESSENCE. “But you know, you have to share enough so you can relate to the people and help others out.”</p><p>Photo: Monyetta Shaw/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWtmaW5fZ4Zwuc6nsJ6spJZ6tLTAsGStmZygwG6uy56lnZ2UYrOiucilsGaqmKSubq3NnWSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
