He’s kept a low profile since the controversial moment took place back in March until Wednesday, Nov. 30. The 54-year-old attended the Los Angeles premiere of “Emancipation” with his wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jada Pinkett Smith</a>, and three adult children, Trey, Willow, and Jaden Smith.</p><p>Photos of the big night were shared on social media, featuring “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” in a three-piece Burgundy suit and black shoes. The “Red Table Talk” host complimented her husband in a cascading white gown with a long elegant train. Trey coordinated with his dad wearing a matching burgundy overcoat, while Willow and Jaden dressed in black and gray ensembles.</p><p>There’s also a photo of Smith lovingly kissing the top of Jada’s bald head, which many viewed as a nod to the unexpected night at the Oscars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Will Smith, Jada Pinkett, Trey, Jaden and Willow at the <a href=#>#Emancipation</a> Premiere in Los Angeles <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GNHDZ9YVDl</a></p>— SARANYA SINGPEM (@SSingpem) <a href=#>December 1, 2022</a></figure><p>The public was torn after Smith walked on stage and smacked Rock across the face after making&nbsp;a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">joke about Jada’s shaved head</a> on Sunday, March 27. It was the same ceremony in which he was awarded his first Best Actor Oscar for his role in the film “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King Richard</a>.” A video of Pinkett Smith seemingly laughing at the assault circulated online afterward.</p><p>Smith was later&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">banned</a> from attending any Academy Awards show or event virtual or in-person for 10 years. And despite apologizing to Rock and the public through various platforms, he still faced criticism and ridicule from fellow actors and entertainers like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Chappelle</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen A. Smith</a>.</p><p>Rock has yet to officially speak on the incident. Instead, he’s made Smith the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">butt of many jokes</a> over the past few months. The incident reportedly will be addressed in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming biopic</a> at Netflix.</p><p>Pinkett Smith has claimed over recent years that she’s struggled with hair loss. She’s expressed that she began <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wearing turbans</a> because chunks of her hair were falling out. On “Red Table Talk,” the actress claimed she’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">battling alopecia</a> and she hopes for Smith and Rock to reconcile.</p><p>“Now, about Oscar night…my deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out, and reconcile,” she said on her talk show. “The state of the world today? We need them both, and we all actually need one another more than ever. Until then, Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years, and that’s keep figuring out this thing called life together. Thank you for listening.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze5BrZmlqX6y2rbiMrKSirJhiuKq%2F0p6qZq%2BZm7JutsCdmGaomaO4psDTZqqmoaSdwG60xJqbZqGeYsGpscirZJ%2BhoqjBbr7EnWScmaKlsrV5xK%2Bcp6xdqbyosdOhnKtlo567pLGMqKqcmaKoerS4wKlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
