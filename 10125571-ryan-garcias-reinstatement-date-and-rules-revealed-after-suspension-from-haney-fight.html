Garcia will be eligible for reinstatement April 20, 2025, provided he passes a drug test.</p><p>"The commission will continue to hold athletes to the highest professional standards and protect the integrity of all sports under our jurisdiction," the NYSAC said in a statement.</p><p>The decision comes after Garcia, 25, <a href=#>announced</a> his retirement Wednesday on social media.<br></p><p>Garcia defeated Haney via majority decision in April. The win was considered a major upset, giving Haney the first loss of his professional career. The result has been overturned and will be a no-contest on both fighters' records.</p><p>"I want to thank the commission and the fans who stood by me during this whole process," Haney told Coppinger. "The facts are the facts, and I wasn't on an even playing field. Happy I was able to receive justice for what happened. It's all part of my story and it's only going to make me better. I look to enjoy this time with my family and friends and see what's next.</p><p>"I'm a clean athlete and boxing is a brutal sport where one fight can literally change your life. I think it important for fighters to be clean and I want to become an advocate for clean athletes for my experience in this situation."</p><p>Garcia has vehemently denied purposefully taking performance-enhancing drugs. His representatives released a statement saying the fight will "never be erased" despite being wiped from the record books.</p><p>"Ryan, with his legal team, has resolved this issue and firmly maintains his truth: he never intentionally took any banned substance," Team Garcia said in a statement provided to ESPN. "It's simply not in his nature. ... The fans will always remember his performance against Haney as a masterclass, and that will never be erased."</p><p>Haney remains the WBC junior welterweight champion, along with holding the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO, and <i>The Ring</i> lightweight titles. He has not announced his next fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqCeH2Mq7Capl2crrOvyJqqZqqVnru0wMCtnKadnql6pa3TnmSappRiv7a4xKxkq52mmq6tscNmmJ%2Bslad6tMHSqZynq5mku26y0aikZqCRo7K6ecWinqGs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
