Two months after Brown <a href=#>filed paperwork to establish paternity</a> of his daughter Royalty, the singer is slamming his baby's mother, model Nia Guzman, and accusing her of using their little girl as a "meal ticket."</p><p>In an overnight Twitter rant on Thursday, Aug. 6, the "Liquor" singer, 26, <a href=#>seethed in two posts</a> that insinuated Guzman was <a href=#>taking advantage of Brown's success</a> for their daughter's sake. Guzman was not directly identified in the posts.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Some men my age run from their responsibility as fathers. I embrace mine. Just sucks that some females use children as meal tickets.</p><p>— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) <a href=#>August 7, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Using a child as leverage is never ok. The highest praise to the men who actually want their kids.</p><p>— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) <a href=#>August 7, 2015</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brown found out that he was a father months after Royalty's July 2014 birth, and is said to be supporting Guzman with a $2,500 monthly stipend, despite Guzman demanding $15,000 a month.</p><p>"A lot has changed in my life, a lot of mistakes, a lot of lessons learned. The best thing, I'm most thankful for is my daughter," Brown, who fathered Royalty while he was dating then-girlfriend <strong>Karrueche Tran</strong>, gushed at the 2015 BET Awards. "At the end of the day, love is love."</p><p>At least on social media, Brown appears to be making good on his intentions to stand by his little girl. "I honestly never knew I could love someone as strong as I do," Brown said in May. "I'm gonna give her the world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhqpmoeqO%2BzrClZpmTmMK0sdJmm5qtl53Bpr7SZqSopV2ks27B0qKloGWSlq%2B6ecCsZJplnZqurXnTopqknaRif3F9lHBv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
